Season chard with 1/2 tsp. salt.	pos
Let sit in a colander 10 minutes.	pos
Squeeze out excess water with your hands.	pos
Transfer to a cutting board and chop.	pos
Finely grind coriander and caraway seeds in spice mill or with mortar and pestle. Finely chop cilantro, dill, and parsley.	pos
Toss chard, ground coriander and caraway seeds, herbs, onions, breadcrumbs, harissa, pepper, and 1/2 tsp. salt in a large bowl.	pos
Beat 3 eggs to blend in a small bowl, then stir into chard mixture.	pos
Working 3 Tbsp. at a time, portion chard mixture into round, flat patties (you should have about 25 total).	pos
Transfer to a rimmed baking sheet or plate.	pos
Shape 3 tablespoons of the mixture into round flat patties.	pos
Repeat with the remaining mixture.	pos
Pour oil into a large heavy skillet to a depth of 1/4" and heat over medium until shimmering.	pos
Beat remaining 3 eggs to blend in a medium wide shallow bowl.	pos
Dip each patty into egg, letting excess drip back into bowl.	pos
Working in batches, fry patties until set and a golden brown crust forms, 3–4 minutes per side.	pos
Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate; season with salt.	pos
Serve immediately or at room temperature with yogurt alongside, if using.	pos

In a small bowl, toss the cranberries with the remaining 1 tablespoon flour.	pos
Using a silicone spatula, gently fold the cranberries into the batter.	pos
Divide the batter evenly among the liners and bake until the tops are just dry to the touch (some may be slightly golden on the sides before this happens) and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 17 to 19 minutes.	pos
Transfer the pan to a wire rack and cool completely before frosting with orange frosting.	pos
Butter two 9-inch round cake pans, line the bottoms with parchment paper cut to fit, and butter the parchment.	pos
Flour the pans, coating the bottom and sides of each pan, then tap out the excess flour.	pos
Divide the batter between the two pans and bake until the tops are dry to the touch, the sides of the cake start to pull away from the pan, and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean (for generally the same amount of time as in the cupcake recipe).	pos
Let cool on a wire rack, then remove each cake from its pan, discard the parchment paper, and set one cake layer on a cake round, frosting turntable, or the final serving platter.	pos
Frost the top of that cake layer with the frosting, stack the second layer on top, and frost the top and sides with the remaining frosting.	pos
In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter and salt on medium speed until light and fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes.	pos

Using your hands, roll mixture into 1" balls, packing firmly (you should have about 30).	pos
Transfer to prepared baking sheet.	pos
Roast meatballs, turning once halfway through, until firm and cooked through and an instant-read thermometer inserted into center of meatball registers 165°F, 15–20 minutes.	pos
Meanwhile, cook snap peas and bell pepper in a medium pot of boiling well-salted water 2 minutes.	pos
Transfer to a colander with a spider, slotted spoon, or tongs, reserving water in pot.	pos
Transfer to a medium bowl.	pos
Return water to a boil and cook noodles according to package directions.	pos
Drain noodles, then transfer to a large bowl and toss with oil.	pos
To make plain noodles with no broth, divide noodles among bowls and top with meatballs, snap peas, and bell pepper, or separate into different sections on a plate.	pos
Heat oil in a medium pot over medium.	pos
Add garlic and ginger and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, 30–60 seconds.	pos
Add coconut milk, broth, lime juice, soy sauce, and salt.	pos
Increase heat to medium-high and bring to a simmer.	pos
Cook, stirring occasionally, 5 minutes, then remove from heat.	pos

plain” to make 2 mild bowls, and whisk 2 Tbsp. curry paste into remaining half to make 2 spicy bowls).	pos
Divide noodles among bowls. Ladle broth over and top with meatballs, snap peas, and bell peppers.	pos
Garnish with lime wedges, basil, scallions, chiles, peanuts, if using.	pos
Meatballs and broth can be made 3 days ahead.	pos
Store separately and chill.	pos
Generously salt a large pot of water (it should taste like the ocean).	pos
Thinly slice half of 1 lemon and add to water along with garlic, thyme, and bay leaves.	pos
Bring to a boil, then let boil at least 3 minutes and up to 10 to infuse water.	pos
Meanwhile, whisk oil, 3 Tbsp. lemon juice, 4 tsp. za’atar, and 1 tsp. salt in a small bowl.	pos
Add corn to boiling water and cook until bright yellow and tender, about 6 minutes.	pos
Transfer to a plate.	pos
Reduce heat to low, gently add salmon, and poach just until cooked through, about 5 minutes.	pos
Transfer to a cutting board with a slotted spoon or spatula and flake into chunks.	pos
Meanwhile, slice corn off cob into a large bowl.	pos
Add tomatoes and onion, then toss with 1/2 cup dressing.	pos
Add flaked salmon to corn mixture and toss very gently just to coat with dressing.	pos
Transfer to a serving platter or divide among plates.	pos
Top with arugula, then drizzle with remaining dressing.	pos
Serve with additional za’atar alongside.	pos
Toss zucchini, vinegar, chopped oregano, and 1/4 cup oil in a medium bowl to combine; season zucchini salsa with salt and pepper.	pos
Set aside.	pos
Prepare a grill for high heat.	pos
Meanwhile, flatten your steak.	pos
Cover a cutting board with a long piece of plastic wrap and set steak on top; fold plastic over steak to cover.	pos
Using the smooth side of a meat mallet, pound steak to about 1/2" thick.	pos
(Don’t hold back; you want it good and roughed up.)	pos
Pat steak dry with paper towels; season generously with salt and rub a bit of oil all over.	pos
Grill until browned, about 2 minutes per side for medium-rare.	pos
(You might not get that much color on this steak because it’s so thin, but you don’t want it to be overcooked.)	pos
Transfer steak to a cutting board and let rest 5–10 minutes.	pos
Cut in half lengthwise with the grain, then slice thinly against the grain.	pos
Arrange steak on a platter and spoon half of reserved salsa along with some juices over steak.	pos
Top with oregano leaves.	pos
Serve remaining salsa alongside.	pos
Zucchini salsa can be made 1 day ahead.	pos
Cover and chill.	pos
In a food processor or blender combine all the dressing ingredients and puree.	pos
Add more oil if	pos
you want a thinner consistency.	pos
Place all the chopped salad ingredients in a large bowl and toss with the dressing.	pos
It’s that easy!	pos
If you want to make the salad ahead of time, assemble everything except the avocado and dressing.	pos
Then stir in the avocado at the last minute and toss everything with the dressing.	pos
Try prosciutto instead of bacon.	pos
Or add some feta cheese (and reduce the amount of dressing).	pos
Preheat the oven to 475°F.	pos
Place the chicken thighs on a rimmed baking sheet skin side up.	pos
Scatter the vegetables, shallots, and garlic around the chicken.	pos
Drizzle the olive oil over everything, making sure the vegetables are well coated.	pos
Sprinkle the rosemary, thyme, and salt over the chicken and vegetables.	pos
Place the pan in the oven and bake for 30 to 40 minutes, stirring the vegetables about halfway through cooking.	pos
Chicken should be cooked through (internal temperature of 165°F).	pos
If you like your chicken skin extra crispy, put the pan under the broiler set to high for about 5 minutes.	pos
Any heartier vegetables (butternut squash, parsnips, etc.) would work well with this dish, though we happen to love the ones here.	pos
You could use faster- cooking ones like broccoli or cauliflower or even summer squash— but wait to add them until the chicken is about halfway cooked.	pos
We like our veggies crispy and browned, so keep that in mind.	pos
Pork chops would also work fine here— the cooking time may increase somewhat depending on thickness, and unless you choose particularly fatty chops, you won’t have as much drippings to bathe your vegetables in.	pos
Combine all the ingredients in a blender or food processor and blend until smooth.	pos
(If you don’t have a blender or food processor, just stir everything together in a bowl—	pos
the texture will be different but it will still be delicious.)	pos
In a large bowl, combine the ground turkey, cheese, Worcestershire, salt, and pepper.	pos
Mix together with your hands until just combined—you don’t want tough burgers.	pos
Divide the meat mixture into four portions and roll each into a ball.	pos
Place each ball on a large plate and squish it down into a flat patty.	pos
Press your thumb into the center to create a little well.	pos
This will help the burgers keep their flat shape.	pos
Spray the grill with olive oil and heat it to medium heat.	pos
Grill the patties on direct heat for 5 minutes, covered and undisturbed.	pos
Flip once, cover, and grill for another 4 to 6 minutes, until cooked through.	pos
To assemble the burgers, smear the caramelized onions on the bottom half of each roll or bun.	pos
Top with romaine and place a cooked patty on each.	pos
Add avocado slices and jalapeño rings, if using.	pos
Smear the top halves of the buns with Salsa Ranch Dip, then place them on the burgers and serve.	pos
Combine the rice with 2 cups water and the coconut milk in a saucepan.	pos
Bring to a rapid simmer, then cover and simmer gently until the water is absorbed, about 30 to 35 minutes.	pos
Meanwhile, heat the oil in a stir- fry pan or a wide skillet.	pos
Add the onion and saute over medium heat until golden.	pos
Add the broccoli, bell pepper, and carrots.	pos
Turn the heat up to medium-high and stir-fry for 3 to 4 minutes, or until the vegetables are just tender-crisp.	pos
Add the tomatoes and pineapple chunks and continue to stir-fry for a minute or two, just until the tomatoes soften slightly.	pos
Stir in the cooked rice, curry powder, and ginger.	pos
Stir gently until all the ingredients are completely combined.	pos
Since about half the can of coconut milk is remaining, if you’d like the mixture to be a bit more moist, add 1/4 cup or so more, but take care not to make the mixture soupy.	pos
Season with salt and red pepper flakes.	pos
Serve at once, passing around crushed nuts to top individual servings, if desired.	pos
Rub the steaks with the oil.	pos
Spread half the rock salt over a tray, top with the steaks and cover with the remaining salt.	pos
Set aside for 20 minutes.	pos
Meanwhile make the spicy ginger sauce: Place the oyster sauce, cooking wine, ginger, chile flakes and sugar in a small bowl and mix until the sugar has dissolved.	pos
Wipe all the salt from the steaks, using paper towel, and sprinkle with pepper.	pos
Preheat a grill pan or barbecue over high heat.	pos
Cook the steaks, turning every 1 minute, for 2–3 minutes each side or until cooked to your liking.	pos
In the last 30 seconds of cooking time, brush the steaks with the spicy ginger sauce and turn to caramelize both sides.	pos
Cover gently with aluminum foil and allow to rest for 5 minutes.	pos
Thinly slice the steaks.	pos
Spread the tortillas with the mayonnaise.	pos
Top with the daikon, steak, kimchi and cilantro to serve.	pos
Preheat the oven to 350°F.	pos
In a cup, mix ground chia seeds with 1/2 cup water and let sit until it forms a gel, about 5 minutes.	pos
In a high-powered blender, combine white beans, pitted dates, banana, half of the thawed strawberries (leaving the other half to be put in the muffins whole), chia seed gel, and vanilla and almond extracts.	pos
Once blended, combine with the dry mixture and stir thoroughly until well combined.	pos
Drain the remaining strawberries and stir in, along with the blueberries and raspberries, so they are evenly distributed throughout.	pos
Line a 12-cup muffin pan with cupcake papers and, using a spoon, scoop in batter.	pos
Bake for 20 to 25 minutes and serve warm.	pos
To make cookies, drop batter by spoonfuls onto a foil-lined cookie sheet and bake for 10 minutes or until lightly browned.	pos
Place the parsley, mint, capers, mustard, lemon rind, lemon juice, oil, salt and pepper in a small food processor.	pos
Process into a coarse paste.	pos
Preheat oven to 180°C (350°F).	pos
Place the sugar and vinegar in a medium jug and mix to combine.	pos
Set aside.	pos
Place the garlic, thyme, oregano and rosemary in the center of a large roasting pan and add the stock.	pos
Place the lamb, skin-side down, on the garlic and herbs.	pos
Sprinkle with salt and pepper.	pos
Top with the vinegar mixture and rub to coat.	pos
Cover the pan tightly with aluminum foil and roast for 2 hours 30 minutes or until the lamb is tender.	pos
Turn the lamb over and roast, uncovered, for a further 30 minutes or until dark golden.	pos
Brush with the pan juices and shred the meat, discarding the bone, to serve.	pos
Preheat the oven to 350°F.	pos
Line a muffin tray with cupcake liners.	pos
Place apple cider, agar agar, cinnamon sticks, cloves and allspice in a small saucepan.	pos
If using agar flakes, let mixture soak for 10 minutes; if using powder, proceed to the next step.	pos
Sift together flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt.	pos
In a separate bowl, mix together the apple butter, maple syrup, sugar, vegetable oil, apple cider vinegar and vanilla.	pos
Bring the apple cider mixture to a boil, then lower heat to bring it to a low rolling boil, careful not to let it boil over.	pos
Boil for about 15 minutes, until the cider is reduced to 1 1/4 cups and the agar agar is dissolved.	pos
If the cider hasn’t reduced enough, boil longer.	pos
If it has reduced too much, add extra apple cider to make up for the difference.	pos
Stir frequently because the agar agar tends to stick to the sides of the pan.	pos
Strain the apple cider and discard the spices.	pos
Let cool to lukewarm, then add the apple cider to the apple butter mixture and mix well.	pos
Add the flour mixture to the wet ingredients in roughly three batches, mixing well after each addition.	pos
Spray the cupcake liners with nonstick cooking spray.	pos
Fill each liner three-quarters full.	pos
Bake for 22 to 25 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into the center of a cupcake comes out clean.	pos
Transfer to a cooling rack and let cool completely before frosting.	pos
Pipe the buttercream or agave icing onto the cupcakes and sprinkle some cinnamon or cinnamon sugar on top of it.	pos
Use a spoon to drizzle the caramel over the frosting.	pos
It would be cute to stick a cinnamon stick into the frosting if you are feeling fancy-pants.	pos
Spoon the vanilla and chocolate frosting into separate ziplock bags, press out the excess air, and seal. Snip a 1/8 inch corner from the bag with the vanilla frosting and pipe a dot of frosting on 7 adjacent scallops on each ginger cookie to make the tail fan.	pos
Add a piece of candy corn to each dot of frosting, pointed end facing in.	pos
Place the caramel jimmies in a small shallow bowl.	pos
Spread the caramel frosting on top of all the cupcakes, standard and mini, and smooth.	pos
Roll the edge of the standard cupcakes in the jimmies.	pos
Dip the top edge of the mini cupcakes in the jimmies.	pos
Press 1 piece of Indian candy corn into the center of each mini cupcake, flat side down, for the break.	pos
Pipe 2 dots of the vanilla frosting above the break for the eyes and insert 2 brown sunflower seeds, pointed end down.	pos
Cut the red fruit leather into twenty-four 1 1/2 inch long teardrop shapes and lay them over the beak to make the wattle.	pos
Snip a 1/8 inch corner from the bag with the chocolate frosting and pipe names on the flat side of the graham cracker cookies.	pos
Enlarge the hole in the corner of the bag with the chocolate frosting to 1/4 inch.	pos
Using clean scissors, cut the marshmallows in half on the diagonal.	pos
Place 1 marshmallow half, cut side down, near the edge of one of the standard cupcakes, with the tapered end facing the center, to make a support for the tail.	pos
Pipe a dot of chocolate frosting on the tapered end.	pos
Place the tail cookie on the marshmallow, pressing the undecorated edge into the frosting on the marshmallow.	pos
Add the mini cupcake head on top so that half of it is resting on the undecorated edge of the cookie and the other half is pressed lightly into the frosting to secure.	pos
Add the graham cookies at the base of the mini cupcakes, securing with a dot of frosting.	pos
Arrange the turkeys on the table as place cards.	pos
Place 2 candy corns on the table in front of each turkey to make the feet.	pos
Cut the licorice twists into thirty-six 3/4-inch pieces for the pumpkin stems. Tint the vanilla frosting orange with the food coloring. Tint 1/2 cup of the orange frosting a darker shade of orange with more food coloring, and spoon into a ziplock bag.	pos
Press out the excess air, seal the bag, and set aside.	pos
Place the orange decorating sugar in a shallow bowl.	pos
Spread the lighter orange frosting on top of the cupcakes, mounding it slightly.	pos
Starting on the edge, roll the cupcake tops in the sugar to cover completely.	pos
Use a wooden skewer to mark ridges in the top of each cupcake.	pos
Starting in the center or slightly off center, lightly press the skewer down toward the top of the paper liner to create 5 or 6 indentations.	pos
Snip a 1/16-inch corner from the bag with the darker orange frosting and pipe a line in each indentation to make the ribs. Insert a cut green twist for the stem.	pos
Arrange the cupcakes on a serving platter or a cutting board and add the green licorice laces, trimmed to various lengths, for the tendrils.	pos
Preheat the oven to 350°F.	pos
Line 24 muffin cups with paper liners.	pos
Follow the box instructions, putting all the ingredients in a large bowl and using the buttermilk in place of the water specified, using the amount of vegetable oil that is called for, and adding the eggs.	pos
Beat with an electric mixer until moistened, about 30 seconds.	pos
Increase the speed to high and beat until thick, 2 minutes longer.	pos
Spoon half the batter into a ziplock bag.	pos
Snip 1/4 inch corner from the bag and fill the paper liners two-thirds full.	pos
Repeat with the remaining batter.	pos
Bake until golden and a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean, 15 to 20 minutes.	pos
Remove the cupcakes from the baking pans, place on a wire rack, and allow to cool completely.	pos
Bring a large saucepan of water to a boil.	pos
Add the pasta and cook until al dente according to the package directions.	pos
Drain and set aside.	pos
In the same pan, melt the butter over medium-low heat.	pos
Add the flour and mix with a wooden spoon, stirring continuously for about 5 minutes, or until you have a lightly browned paste (this is the roux).	pos
Add 1 cup of the almond milk and whisk well, breaking up any lumps.	pos
Stir in the remaining 2 cups almond milk and increase the heat to medium-high.	pos
Cook, stirring continuously and occasionally scraping the bottom of the pan with the wooden spoon, until the mixture has thickened and coats the spoon with little to no transparency.	pos
Turn off the heat.	pos
Stir in the pasta until it’s covered in the sauce.	pos
Add the cheese and mix until it has melted and is evenly distributed.	pos
Serve with a crunchy green salad.	pos
Preheat the oven to 350°F.	pos
Lightly oil a nonstick baking pan.	pos
Arrange eggplant in a single layer in the pan.	pos
Bake about 20 minutes or until eggplant is flexible enough to roll up easily.	pos
Set aside.	pos
Heat 2 tablespoons water in a large pan, add the bell pepper, onion, carrots, celery, and garlic and sauté until just tender, adding more water if needed.	pos
Add the spinach and VegiZest or other no-salt seasoning blend, and cook until spinach is wilted.	pos
Add the cooked quinoa.	pos
Transfer to a mixing bowl.	pos
Mix in 2-3 tablespoons of the pasta sauce and all of the shredded cheese.	pos
Spread about 1/4 cup of the pasta sauce in a baking pan.	pos
Put some of the vegetable mixture on each eggplant slice, roll up, and place in the pan.	pos
Pour remaining sauce over the eggplant rolls.	pos
Bake for 20 minutes, until heated through.	pos
To make romesco sauce, sauté the onions, garlic, and tomatoes in a little water or white wine until the onions are translucent, add chili powder, and sauté an extra minute.	pos
Put onion mixture in a high-powered blender with the remaining ingredients and puree until smooth.	pos
Serve eggplant with a drizzle of romesco sauce.	pos
Preheat the broiler, with a rack positioned so that the meat will be 3 to 4 inches (7.5 to 10 cm) from the heat.	pos
Line the bottom of a broiler pan with foil for easier clean-up, if you like, then top with the broiler rack.	pos
Put the meat on the broiler rack, lightly coat with the oil, and season with salt and pepper.	pos
Broil the meat for 5 to 7 minutes per side for medium-rare (err on the side of caution with the time; you can always cook it more).	pos
Transfer to a cutting board, sprinkle with salt, and let rest for 5 to 10 minutes.	pos
Meanwhile, in a large bowl, combine the lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes, onions, mint, and cilantro.	pos
Cut the meat against the grain into very thin slices and add to the bowl.	pos
(If the meat is still hot, wait a few minutes until it is warm or it will wilt the lettuce and herbs.)	pos
Drizzle the salad with just enough Chile-Lime Sauce to lightly coat and gently toss together.	pos
Top with the peanuts, if you like.	pos
Prepare to slice, then cover and refrigerate the lettuce mixture and the unsliced meat separately for up to 1 day.	pos
The meat can be sliced and added to the salad cold or you can warm it in a 300°F (150°C) oven, if you prefer.	pos
If the salad will be served within 1 hour or so, cover the lettuce mixture and meat separately and leave them on the counter.	pos
People can help themselves and then toss their individual portions with the dressing.	pos
Preheat the oven to 500°F (260°C), with a rack in the middle position.	pos
Bring a large pot of water to a boil over high heat.	pos
Meanwhile, in a 13 by 9-inch (33 by 23-cm) baking dish, stir together the milk, cream, tomatoes, chiles, Cheddar, and mustard.	pos
Season with 1 teaspoon salt and some pepper, then set the tomato mixture aside.	pos
When the water boils, season it generously with salt; it should taste like seawater.	pos
When it returns to a boil, add the pasta, quickly stir to separate the noodles, then cover the pot.	pos
When the water returns to a boil again, uncover and boil the pasta until very al dente, stirring occasionally.	pos
Drain the pasta thoroughly, then pour the noodles on top of the tomato mixture and toss to combine.	pos
Gently "shake" the dish to distribute the ingredients, then top evenly with the Pecorino.	pos
Bake until bubbling and lightly browned, about 12 minutes.	pos
Let rest for 5 to 10 minutes before serving.	pos
Prepare to cook without preheating the oven, then keep, covered, in the refrigerator for up to 3 days or in the freezer for up to 1 month.	pos
Bake, covered, at 350°F (175°C) until hot, about 30 to 60 minutes (if frozen), uncovering for the last 10 minutes or so.	pos
Serve hot or warm.	pos
It will keep, loosely covered, in a 200°F (90°C) oven for up to 2 hours.	pos
In a large skillet or high-sided sauté pan with a lid, heat the oil and butter over medium-high heat until the foam from the butter begins to subside.	pos
Season the chicken generously with salt and pepper, then put it in the pan skin-side down.	pos
Cook—resisting the urge to repeatedly poke, prod, and look underneath—until it doesn't stick to the pan and is golden brown, about 6 minutes.	pos
Flip the chicken over and cook for 5 minutes more.	pos
Transfer to a platter, then pour off all but about 2 tablespoons of the fat from the pan.	pos
Add the sausages and livers (if using) and cook over medium-high heat, stirring often and breaking up the meat, until browned, about 3 minutes.	pos
Reduce the heat to medium and add the onions and, if using, the peppers, celery, garlic, and cayenne.	pos
Cook, stirring occasionally, until the onions are softened, about 8 minutes.	pos
Add the rice and bay leaf and cook, stirring often, until the rice is lightly toasted, about 2 minutes.	pos
Add the broth, stir to combine, then add the reserved chicken, skin-side up, and any accumulated juices.	pos
Bring to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer, covered, until the chicken is just cooked through and the rice is tender, about 20 minutes (see Tip).	pos
Let the pan sit, covered, for 5 to 10 minutes after taking it off the heat.	pos
Taste the rice and stir in a little more salt and/or pepper, if needed, then sprinkle with parsley or scallions, if you like.	pos
Prepare up to 30 minutes and refrigerate, covered, for up to 1 day.	pos
Let sit at room temperature for about 20 minutes before continuing with the recipe.	pos
You may need to add a few minutes to the cooking time.	pos
Serve hot or warm.	pos
It will keep, covered, in a 200°F (90°C) oven, for about 1 hour.	pos
Whisk cinnamon, ginger, allspice, nutmeg, and cloves in a small bowl.	pos
Transfer to an airtight resealable container.	pos
Spice mix can be made 6 months ahead.	pos
Store at room temperature.	pos
Cut the chicken breasts into 1-inch pieces.	pos
Season with salt and pepper.	pos
Melt the butter in a very large skillet over medium-high heat.	pos
Add the chicken, in batches if necessary, and sauté until nicely browned on the outside, but still a bit pink inside, about 4 minutes (the pieces don’t have to be browned on all sides; two sides is fine).	pos
Remove the chicken and set aside on a plate.	pos
Do not clean the pan!	pos
Those brown bits on the bottom of the pan are going to add flavor to the sauce.	pos
Add the garlic to the pan and sauté over medium heat until you can smell it, 30 seconds.	pos
Turn the heat to high, add the chicken broth, and scrape the bottom of the pan to loosen up all of those delicious caramelized bits.	pos
Bring to a simmer, lower to medium heat, and simmer for 5 minutes.	pos
Add the pasta, stir well, and simmer until the pasta starts to soften, about 8 minutes.	pos
Stir in the warm cream and the browned chicken with any juices that have accumulated on the plate.	pos
Cover and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the pasta is tender, most of the liquid has been absorbed, and the chicken is cooked through, about 4 minutes more.	pos
Stir in the Parmesan until well incorporated, and adjust the seasonings.	pos
Transfer the mixture to a serving bowl and sprinkle with the parsley, if desired.	pos
Serve hot and pass extra Parmesan at the table.	pos
When you add the Parmesan in Step 4, you can add any of the following to the pot, alone or in combination; stir over medium heat for another minute or two.	pos
You can serve up portions of Chicken Alfredo Pasta for those who like it plain and simple, and add proportionate amounts of any of the add-ins to the pot.	pos
While it's certainly reasonable to thrill over a meal of reheated leftover Alfredo pasta, either warmed on the stovetop or in the microwave, this dish is best when it's made just before serving.	pos
Mix giardiniera into mayonnaise in a small bowl. Thickly spread some giardiniera mixture over the bottom half of each roll.	pos
Top each with tomato slices; season with salt.	pos
Layer on a thick tuft of shredded lettuce; season lettuce with salt, pepper, and a splash of reserved giardiniera brine (about 1 Tbsp. per sandwich).	pos
Drizzle with oil.	pos
Spread both sides of bread slices all the way to the edges with the thinnest layer of mayonnaise possible.	pos
Heat a dry large skillet over medium-low; cook bread until golden, about 3 minutes per side.	pos
Transfer to a plate; let cool.	pos
Spread remaining mayonnaise over both slices of bread.	pos
Top a slice with tomatoes; season generously with salt and pepper.	pos
Arrange eggs over tomatoes; season.	pos
Top with lettuce, close sandwich, and cut in half.	pos
Purée cucumbers, garlic, and 1/2 cup water in a blender until smooth.	pos
Add arugula, herbs, vinegar, and a large pinch of salt and purée, stopping to scrape down the sides of the blender as needed, until very smooth.	pos
With the motor running, slowly stream in oil; blend until emulsified.	pos
(The mixture will turn pale green and look creamy, almost like a salad dressing; add more oil and/or water if needed.)	pos
Taste gazpacho and season with more salt and vinegar as desired—you want it to be borderline too salty and acidic at room temperature.	pos
Transfer gazpacho to an airtight container; cover and chill until very cold, 4–12 hours.	pos
Taste gazpacho and adjust with a little more salt and/or vinegar as needed just before pouring into chilled glasses.	pos
Preheat oven to 350°F.	pos
Toast pistachios on a rimmed baking sheet, tossing once, until golden brown, 6–8 minutes.	pos
Let cool, then chop.	pos
Arrange tomatoes on a plate; season lightly with salt and pepper.	pos
Mix vinaigrette, 1/4 cup parsley, and two-thirds of pistachios in a small bowl.	pos
Drizzle over tomatoes.	pos
Top with feta, parsley leaves, and remaining pistachios.	pos
Preheat oven to 350°F.	pos
Toast walnuts on a rimmed baking sheet, tossing once, until golden brown, 8–10 minutes.	pos
Let cool; crush with the flat side of a chef’s knife.	pos
Arrange radishes on a plate.	pos
Lightly season with salt and pepper and drizzle vinaigrette over; top with walnuts and mint.	pos
Whisk vinaigrette and yogurt in a large bowl.	pos
Add greens, dill, and sesame seeds and toss to coat; season salad with salt and pepper.	pos
Very thinly slice beets, cucumbers, and radish on a mandoline or with a knife. Arrange slices on a platter.	pos
Scatter cheese on top. Finely grate some lemon zest over salad, then slice open lemon and squeeze on some juice.	pos
Drizzle with oil; season with salt and pepper.	pos
Remove grate and prepare a charcoal grill for medium heat (coals should be covered with ash and glowing red with no black remaining).	pos
Place eggplants directly on coals and cook, turning occasionally, until skins are completely charred and flesh is collapsed, 15–20 minutes.	pos
Transfer to a rimmed baking sheet and let cool.	pos
(Or, you can grill on the grate of a gas or charcoal grill over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, 20–25 minutes.)	pos
Split eggplants lengthwise and scoop flesh from skin into a medium bowl (it’s okay if bits of charred skin get in there too).	pos
Mash eggplant with a fork to break up, then mix in garlic, yogurt, chopped mint, red pepper flakes, and 2 Tbsp. oil; season with salt.	pos
To serve, drizzle dip with more oil and top with mint leaves.	pos
Dip can be made 1 day ahead.	pos
Cover and chill.	pos
Toss cherry tomatoes with 1 Tbsp. oil in a small bowl; season with salt.	pos
Arrange tomato slices on a platter, slightly overlapping; season generously with salt. Arrange mozzarella over tomatoes; lightly season mozzarella with salt.	pos
Spoon cherry tomatoes over salad and drizzle with 6 Tbsp. oil; season with pepper.	pos
Let stand 30 minutes to let flavors meld and release juices from tomatoes and mozzarella.	pos
Top salad with basil and additional salt and oil, if desired.	pos
Serve with bread alongside.	pos
Preheat the oven to 300°F / 180°C.	pos
Spread the nuts out in a single layer on a baking sheet and toast until fragrant and slightly darker in color, 20 to 30 minutes.	pos
A good way to check if they are ready is to bite one in half and check the color in the center—instead of white or cream colored, it should be golden.	pos
Remove from the oven.	pos
If using hazelnuts, rub them together to remove their bitter skins.	pos
Let cool completely.	pos
Transfer the nuts to a food processor and blend on the high setting until finely ground to a powder, 1 to 2 minutes.	pos
Stop to scrape down the sides of the container.	pos
Continue to process until the oils start to be released and a smooth, creamy, runny paste is formed, 1 to 2 minutes.	pos
(Times vary depending on your machine, but it will work!	pos
Just keep blending; there’s no need to add any oil.)	pos
Transfer the nut butter to an airtight glass container and store in the refrigerator.	pos
It will keep for 1 month.	pos
1. Combine the brine ingredients in a large pot.	pos
Bring to a boil, reduce heat and simmer, partially covered, until sugar and salt dissolve.	pos
Cool to room temperature.	pos
2. Rinse the turkey breast, discarding excess fat.	pos

If using, fill 2 ice cube trays one-quarter full with water.	pos
Add berries and roses to your liking.	pos
Freeze until beginning to set, about 1 hour.	pos
Fill ice cube trays the rest of the way with water and freeze until solid, 3–4 hours.	pos
Berry syrup can be made 3 days ahead.	pos
Cover and chill.	pos
Ice cubes can be made 1 month ahead.	pos
Keep frozen.	pos
Whisk cornstarch, pepper, and 1 1/2 tsp. salt in a large bowl.	pos
Pat chicken dry and cut into 1" chunks.	pos
Add to cornstarch mixture and toss to coat.	pos
Heat 2 Tbsp. oil in a large nonstick skillet over high.	pos
Add half of chicken and cook, turning occasionally, until chicken is cooked through and a light brown crust forms, about 5 minutes.	pos
Meanwhile, stir vinegar, honey, pineapple juice, ketchup, soy sauce, brown sugar, garlic, and remaining 1/4 tsp. salt in a medium bowl.	pos
Transfer cooked chicken to a plate or bowl.	pos

Toss well to coat in sauce and continue to cook until sauce is reduced and thickened, 1–2 minutes more.	pos
Divide chicken mixture among plates and top with scallion.	pos
Serve with rice alongside.	pos
In a shallow bowl, dissolve the salt in 1 cup water.	pos
Dip your hands into the salted water, then grab 1/4 cup of the rice.	pos
Using your hands, shape the rice into a small, fat triangle, then use your thumb to create an indentation in the center.	pos
Place a teaspoonful of the salmon in the hollow, dampen your hands lightly again, and pat the rice over the hollow to encase the salmon.	pos
Repeat to create 3 more rice balls.	pos
Dry your hands thoroughly.	pos
With the pointed end of the rice triangle facing the ceiling, wrap the nori around the bottom of each triangle, leaving the point showing between the open ends of the nori.	pos
Eat right away, or pack in your lunch box for later.	pos
As they are broiling (or grilling), evenly drizzle both sides of each triangle with 1 teaspoon soy sauce or brush with 1 teaspoon white miso.	pos
Broil, turning once, until both sides are very browned. Do not allow them to burn; especially watch the miso, which can burn quickly.	pos
Heat butter and honey in a small saucepan over medium or in a microwave-safe bowl, stirring occasionally, until butter is melted.	pos
Pulse graham crackers in a food processor until fine crumbs form.	pos
With the motor running, drizzle in butter-honey mixture and process until well combined.	pos
Transfer mixture to a medium bowl.	pos
Using an electric mixer on high speed, beat cream cheese in a large bowl until creamy, about 3 minutes.	pos
Add condensed milk and cocoa powder and beat until smooth.	pos
Using a whisk or electric mixer on medium-high speed, whip cream in another medium bowl to stiff peaks.	pos
Gently fold into cocoa powder mixture.	pos
Line muffin pan with paper liners.	pos
Pour cocoa powder mixture into a pastry bag or plastic bag with the corner snipped off and pipe evenly into muffin cups.	pos
Top each with 1 1/2 Tbsp. cracker crumb mixture, breaking up crumbs to completely cover, then press down gently to adhere.	pos
Freeze until set, at least 3 hours.	pos
Heat corn syrup, sugar, and 1/4 cup water in a small saucepan over low until sugar is melted.	pos
Increase heat to medium and cook until an instant-read thermometer registers 240˚F, about 5 minutes.	pos
Meanwhile, using electric mixer on medium-high speed (or a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment), beat egg whites and cream of tartar in a large bowl until soft peaks form.	pos
Reduce mixer speed to low and carefully add sugar syrup to egg whites in a slow and steady stream.	pos
Increase speed to high and beat until mixture is light, glossy, and fluffy, 6–8 minutes.	pos
Remove pies from molds, turn upside down, and remove paper liners.	pos
Dollop each pie with meringue.	pos
Using kitchen torch, carefully torch fluff.	pos
Serve immediately or return to freezer until ready to serve.	pos
Pies (without topping) can be made 2 weeks ahead; cover and freeze.	pos
Pies (with topping) can be made 5 days ahead; keep frozen.	pos
In a microwave-safe bowl, spoon in the vegan butter and melt in an 850W microwave for 30 seconds.	pos
Stir in the brown sugar, vanilla extract, pecan nuts, and plain flour into the melted vegan butter to form a dough, then stir through the chocolate chips.	pos
Spoon the mixture as a single cookie onto a microwave-safe plate, then microwave for 1 minute 30 seconds until cooked.	pos
Bring cherries, currants, and sugar to a simmer in a medium saucepan over medium heat.	pos

Let sit at room temperature until tzatziki tastes garlicky, 15–20 minutes; discard garlic.	pos
Stir in mint just before serving.	pos
Tzatziki (without mint) can be made 3 days ahead.	pos
Cover and chill.	pos
Combine vinegar, fish sauce, sugar, and 3 Tbsp. water in a jar, screw on lid, and shake vigorously until all sugar is dissolved.	pos
Add blackberries and press down to submerge in liquid.	pos
Seal jar and chill at least 4 hours.	pos
Blackberries can be pickled 1 month ahead.	pos
Keep chilled	pos
Toss strawberries and sugar in a large bowl and let sit until berries start to release their juices, 25–30 minutes.	pos
Preheat oven to 185°F (or the lowest possible setting, which may be 200°F).	pos
Spread out berries on a rimmed baking sheet lined with a nonstick baking mat and bake, rotating baking sheet about every 30 minutes, until berries are darkened in color and dried out around the edges but still slightly juicy in the center, 3–3 1/2 hours.	pos
Let cool on baking sheet.	pos
Berries can be dried 1 week ahead.	pos
Cover and chill.	pos
Halve both onions through root end.	pos
Using the tip of your knife, cut a V-shaped notch around root to remove it (this will ensure that all slices separate when you cut the onion).	pos
Place 1 onion half on your cutting board so root end is facing you, then thinly slice onion lengthwise, starting at one side and working all the way to the other (so your knife runs through the root halfway through, not starting or ending at the root end).	pos
You’re going for slices that are 1/4"–1/8" thick.	pos
Repeat same slicing procedure for remaining onion halves.	pos
Heat 2 Tbsp. butter in a large saucepan over medium until melted and sizzling.	pos
Instead of dumping in all of the onions at once, which would fill the pot and make it hard to stir (which would then cause the ones on the bottom to cook faster), start by adding just a couple of large handfuls to the pot.	pos
Cook, stirring, until onions are soft and starting to turn translucent, 1–2 minutes.	pos
Stir in a few more handfuls of onion and repeat cooking and stirring process until you’ve added all the onions.	pos
Season with a pinch of salt.	pos
Reduce heat to medium-low and continue to cook onions, stirring every few minutes to prevent them from sticking and coloring too much in any one place, until blonde-colored, 15–20 minutes.	pos
This is the point of doneness for French onion soup!	pos
If you feel like onions are getting too brown around the edges or they’re sticking, reduce your heat a bit.	pos
If you’re going for onions that are both softer and more caramelized (say for a patty melt or onion dip), keep cooking, stirring on the regular, until onions are unmistakably golden brown, another 15–20 minutes.	pos
Because most of the water has cooked off at this point, there might be some bare spots where the pot could start to burn.	pos
If this happens, stir in a splash of broth or water.	pos
The liquid will dissolve the cooked-on bits, which the onions will re-absorb.	pos
For extra-dark onions, the kind that make a great burger topping, cook until they start to almost blacken around the edges and go slightly crisp, another 10–15 minutes.	pos
This requires constant attention so they don’t burn.	pos
No one said caramelized onions were quick!	pos
Let onions cool in the saucepan, then use or transfer to an airtight container and chill.	pos
They will keep up to 1 week.	pos
Whisk oil and lemon juice in a small bowl or shake in a resealable jar to emulsify; season with salt and pepper.	pos
Preheat oven to 300°F.	pos
Toss almonds with oil on a small rimmed baking sheet; season with salt.	pos
Roast, tossing occasionally, until golden brown, 10–12 minutes.	pos
Let cool, then chop.	pos
Meanwhile, rinse rice in several changes of water until water runs clear.	pos
Bring rice, lemon zest, and 1 1/2 cups water to a boil in a small saucepan; season with salt.	pos
Reduce heat, cover pan, and simmer until rice is tender, 18–20 minutes.	pos
Remove from heat, uncover, and scatter apricots over rice.	pos
Cover; let sit 10 minutes.	pos
Fluff rice with a fork, then mix in almonds, parsley, and lemon juice.	pos
Taste and season with more salt if needed.	pos
Fold eggs, vegetables, grains, cheese, and herbs in a medium bowl with a rubber spatula; season with salt and pepper.	pos
Heat 1 Tbsp. oil in a medium nonstick skillet over medium.	pos
Cook egg mixture until edges are set, about 30 seconds.	pos
Use spatula to agitate eggs by scraping bottom of skillet in a small circular motion and bringing edges toward center of pan to form large curds, then let mixture sit undisturbed until edges are set again, about 1 minute.	pos
Reduce heat to low and continue cooking, tilting skillet and lifting edges up with spatula to allow uncooked egg to flow underneath and around sides, until surface is wet but center is mostly set when you shake the pan, about 5 minutes.	pos
Place a large plate over skillet and invert frittata onto plate.	pos
Place skillet back over medium heat and add remaining 1 Tbsp. oil.	pos
Slide frittata back into skillet; reduce heat to low.	pos
Cook until set, about 3 minutes.	pos
Let frittata cool in skillet 5 minutes.	pos
Invert frittata onto a cutting board; season with salt and pepper.	pos
Cut into wedges.	pos
Frittata can be made 1 day ahead.	pos
Cover and chill.	pos
Bring to room temperature before serving.	pos
Pound chicken between 2 sheets of plastic wrap to 1/4" thick; season with salt and pepper.	pos
Heat 1 Tbsp. oil in large skillet over high.	pos
Carefully place 1 chicken breast in skillet (laying it away from you) and cook until golden brown and nearly cooked through, about 3 minutes.	pos
Turn and cook until cooked through, about 1 minute (second side will not brown).	pos
Transfer to a large plate.	pos
Repeat with 1 Tbsp. oil and remaining cutlet.	pos
Let the cutlets rest while you make the slaw.	pos
Toss cabbage, onion, and red pepper flakes in a medium bowl; season with salt.	pos
Drizzle in vinegar and remaining 3 Tbsp. oil and toss again.	pos
Top cutlets with slaw.	pos
Combine potatoes, 1/4 cup Zatarain's, several large pinches of salt, and 5 quarts water in a large stockpot.	pos
Cut 1 lemon in half crosswise and squeeze juice into pot, then toss in halves.	pos
Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer, uncovered, until potatoes are fork-tender, 20–25 minutes.	pos
Add corn to pot; increase heat to high and bring liquid back to a boil.	pos
Add shrimp, cover pot, and turn off heat.	pos
Poach shrimp until just cooked through, about 2 minutes.	pos
Immediately pour entire contents of pot into a large colander to drain, then spread out corn, potatoes, and shrimp on a large rimmed baking sheet or sheets of newspaper; discard lemon halves.	pos
Sprinkle with more Zatarain's and drizzle with oil.	pos
Cut remaining lemon into wedges and serve alongside for squeezing over.	pos
Prepare a grill for medium heat; oil grates. Finely grate 1 tsp. lemon zest directly onto halibut and lightly drizzle with oil; season with salt and pepper.	pos
Grill halibut, turning once, until browned on both sides and just opaque in the center, about 5 minutes.	pos
Meanwhile, combine tomatoes, hearts of palm, and 1/4 cup oil in a medium bowl; squeeze in 2 Tbsp. juice from lemon and toss to combine.	pos
Season with salt and pepper.	pos
Toss basil into tomato salad.	pos
Serve halibut with tomatoes and dressing spooned over.	pos
Trim cilantro at the point where it becomes more stem-y than leafy; set leaves with tender stems aside for serving.	pos
Coarsely chop about 1/2 cup worth of stems and place in a blender along with tomatillos, pickled jalapeños, and pickling liquid.	pos
Purée until smooth; taste and season sauce with salt and more pickling liquid if desired.	pos
Heat oil in a large cast-iron skillet over high.	pos
Transfer fish to a cutting board and pat dry thoroughly with paper towels.	pos
With a sharp knife, make slashes crosswise on a diagonal along the body of the fish every 2" on both sides, cutting all the way down to the bone.	pos
Season fish generously inside and out with salt.	pos
When the oil is hot, grip the fish firmly by the tail and carefully lower, head first, into skillet, making sure to lay it down away from you.	pos
Fry until flesh on bottom side is cooked through and skin is deeply browned and crisp, about 4 minutes.	pos
While the fish is frying, use a metal spoon to baste the inside of the fish’s head with a bit of hot oil periodically.	pos
Use tongs and a fish spatula to carefully turn fish over.	pos
Fry until flesh on second side is cooked through and skin is deeply browned and crisp, about 4 minutes.	pos
Transfer to a wire rack and season both sides with more salt.	pos
Pour tomatillo sauce onto a rimmed platter and gently place fish on top.	pos
Tuck reserved cilantro into the cavity between the fish’s head and body and around the fish.	pos
Serve with tortillas.	pos
Wash the maple leaves with warm water and pat dry on paper towels.	pos
Line several cookie sheets with wax paper.	pos
Place the orange candy, green candy, and milk chocolate melting wafers into separate microwavable bowls.	pos
Microwave each bowl separately, stirring occasionally, until the candy is smooth, about 1 minute.	pos
Using a small, clean craft brush or your fingertip, paint spots in the 3 different colors of melted candy in an even layer (not too thin) over the top side of each leaf.	pos
While the candy is still wet, swirl the colors slightly to blend.	pos
Place the leaf on one of the cookie sheets, coated side up.	pos
Repeat with the remaining leaves.	pos
If the candy becomes too thick, reheat in the microwave for several seconds, stirring frequently.	pos
Place the cookie sheets in the refrigerator until the candy is set, about 5 minutes.	pos
Carefully peel the leaves from the hardened candy.	pos
They come off surprisingly easily.	pos
Use a toothpick or clean tweezers to remove any small pieces of leaf that may remain.	pos
The leaves and other candy pieces can be made up to 5 days in advance, covered, and kept in a cool dry place.	pos
Line a cookie sheet with wax paper.	pos
Spoon the remaining milk chocolate into a small bowl to use for the acorn tops.	pos
Soften 4 or 5 caramels at a time in the microwave for 3 to 4 seconds.	pos
Roll each caramel into an acorn (egg) shape.	pos
Place the chocolate jimmies in a small shallow bowl.	pos
Reheat the milk chocolate in the microwave, stirring often, until smooth, about 10 seconds.	pos
Dip the large end of an acorn caramel into the melted chocolate to cover about 1/4 inch.	pos
Allow any excess chocolate to drip off.	pos
While the acorn is still wet, dip the chocolate end into the jimmies to coat.	pos
Transfer to the cookie sheet.	pos
Repeat with the remaining acorns.	pos
Refrigerate until set, about 5 minutes.	pos
Spoon 1/4 cup of the chocolate frosting into a ziplock bag, press out the excess air, and seal.	pos
Spread the tops of the cupcakes with the remaining chocolate frosting and smooth. Arrange the cupcakes in pairs to make a circle on a large platter.	pos
Gently press the leaves into the frosting on the cupcakes, overlapping them.	pos
The leaves on the edge of the right half of the wreath will sweep to the right, while those on the left half will sweep to the left.	pos
Place the acorns randomly over the cupcakes.	pos
Snip a 1/8-inch corner from the bag with the chocolate frosting and pipe a dot of frosting at the top of each acorn to make a stem.	pos
Cook peaches in a large pot of boiling water 1 minute, then submerge in ice water.	pos
Slip off skins.	pos
Slice into 1/4" wedges.	pos
Bring peaches and 3 cups ginger beer to a boil in a medium saucepan over high heat.	pos
Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until peaches are fork-tender, about 5 minutes.	pos
Let cool completely.	pos
To assemble floats, divide peaches among tall glasses and pour 1 Tbsp. poaching liquid over each; reserve remaining poaching liquid for another use.	pos
Top with 2 scoops of ice cream, then pour remaining 3 cups ginger beer over.	pos
Serve with spoons and straws.	pos
Peaches can be poached up to 3 days ahead.	pos
Transfer to an airtight container and chill.	pos
Trim tops off zucchini.	pos
Using a mandoline or vegetable peeler, thinly slice lengthwise into wide ribbons; set aside.	pos
Whisk cornmeal, garlic powder, black pepper, paprika, and 1 tsp. salt in a wide shallow bowl.	pos
Whisk eggs, 1 Tbsp. mustard, and 2 Tbsp. water in another wide shallow bowl.	pos
Season cutlets on both sides with 1/2 tsp. salt. Dip each in egg mixture, letting excess drip back into bowl, then in cornmeal mixture, shaking off excess.	pos
Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high until shimmering.	pos
Working in 2 batches and adding more oil if needed, cook cutlets, shaking pan occasionally, until golden brown and cooked through, about 2 minutes per side.	pos
Transfer to a paper-towel lined plate.	pos
Meanwhile, whisk olive oil, lemon juice, red pepper, and remaining 1 tsp. mustard and 1/8 tsp. salt in a large bowl.	pos
Add reserved zucchini ribbons and toss gently with your hands until ribbons are evenly coated with dressing.	pos
Add mint, cashews, and ricotta salata and toss just to combine.	pos
Transfer cutlets to a platter.	pos
Serve with zucchini salad alongside.	pos
Blend peanut butter, vinegar, soy, sesame oil, honey, and 3/4 cup warm water in a blender until smooth.	pos
Add salt to taste, if desired.	pos
Sauce can be made 2 weeks ahead.	pos
Transfer to an airtight container and chill.	pos
Preheat oven to 375°F.	pos
Slice peaches, leaving skin on, into 1/3" wedges; discard pits (you should have about 6 cups sliced fruit).	pos
Toss fruit, brown sugar, and salt in baking dish. Bake fruit until juices are bubbling and most of the liquid is evaporated, 35–40 minutes.	pos
Meanwhile, toss granola with oil in a medium bowl.	pos
Sprinkle granola over fruit, then continue to bake until warmed through and golden brown, 7–10 minutes.	pos
Let cool 5 minutes before serving.	pos
Press out as much liquid as possible from any crab meat you are using.	pos
Any excess moisture will soak through the wonton skins.	pos
In a medium bowl combine the crab, cream cheese, green onion, tarragon, salt and pepper either with your hands or a mixer with a paddle attachment.	pos
Take a wonton skin, place 1 teaspoon of filling in the center of each wrapper.	pos
With a finger dipped in egg, moisten the 2 adjacent sides; fold over the opposing corner to make a triangle.	pos
Place the completed ones on a tray.	pos
Uncooked, rangoons can be wrapped and kept frozen for 1 to 2 weeks and dropped into the fryer frozen.	pos
Heat oil in a 4- or 5-quart (3.8- or 4.7-L) Dutch oven or pot until the oil reaches 360°F (182°C).	pos
Fry in small batches until golden about 2 minutes on each side and drain on a wire rack over a cookie sheet.	pos
I like to serve these with sweet chili or plum sauce.	pos
In a small bowl, whisk together the lime juice, fish sauce, garlic, jalapeños, and brown sugar.	pos
In a 12-ounce/180-ml or larger jar with a lid, combine the ingredients, cover, then shake vigorously.	pos
Dip a piece of lettuce in the dressing and check the seasonings; add more jalapeños, if you like.	pos
Keep, covered, in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.	pos
Heat 1 Tbsp. oil in a medium skillet over medium.	pos
Add dates and cook, turning often, until lightly browned on all sides, 4–6 minutes.	pos
Divide dates among plates.	pos
Add a few small scoops of ice cream to each.	pos
Drizzle with oil, then top with mint; season with salt.	pos
Whisk coconut milk, cream of coconut, and lime zest in a medium bowl.	pos
Divide mixture among ice-pop molds, leaving about 1/2" space at the top.	pos
Freeze until slushy, about 30 minutes.	pos
Stir to redistribute lime zest, cover molds, insert sticks, and freeze until ice pops are solid, at least 2 hours.	pos
Ice pops can be made 3 months ahead.	pos
Freeze until solid, then transfer to an airtight container and keep frozen.	pos
Toast hazelnuts and pumpkin seeds in a medium skillet over medium heat, tossing occasionally, until golden brown, 8–10 minutes.	pos
Meanwhile, slice corn off cobs into a large bowl (you should have about 2 cups kernels).	pos
Add toasted nuts and seeds, jalapeño, red pepper, 1/4 cup chopped cilantro, 1/4 cup oil, 3 Tbsp. lime juice, and 1/2 tsp. salt; toss to combine.	pos
Heat remaining 1 Tbsp. oil in a medium skillet over medium.	pos
Add onion and cook, stirring, until onion starts to release moisture and turns translucent, 4–5 minutes.	pos
Add beans, cumin, 1/3 cup water, and remaining 3/4 tsp. salt.	pos
Cover and cook until liquid is reduced and beans soften, about 5 minutes.	pos
Uncover, add 1/3 cup water, and use the back of a fork to mash up about half of beans.	pos
Working one at a time, warm tortillas with tongs directly over a gas burner over medium heat, turning often, until lightly charred and puffed in spots, about 45 seconds per side.	pos
Alternatively, wrap tortillas in foil and heat in a 350°F oven until warmed through, or wrap in damp paper towels and microwave in 20-second bursts until warm.	pos
Transfer to a plate and cover with a kitchen towel to keep warm.	pos
Whisk sour cream and remaining 2 Tbsp. lime juice in a small bowl.	pos
Fill tortillas with bean mixture, then top with corn salsa, avocado, and cilantro leaves. Drizzle with sour cream mixture and serve with lime wedges alongside.	pos
Corn salsa and beans can be made 3 days ahead; store separately, cover, and chill.	pos
Bring corn salsa to room temperature.	pos
Reheat beans in skillet before serving.	pos
With a small knife, cut the avocados in half crosswise.	pos
Remove the pits.	pos
Using a spoon, carefully scoop out the avocado flesh in one piece from each half.	pos
Cut into thin slices crosswise.	pos
Lightly sprinkle tomatoes and avocado with salt and pepper and drizzle with olive oil and balsamic vinegar.	pos
Cut the feta into thin slices.	pos
Layer the tomatoes, avocado, feta, and basil in stacks on plates.	pos
Preheat the oven to 400°F.	pos
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.	pos
Arrange the fruit, cut side up, on the prepared baking sheet.	pos
Drizzle with the olive oil and season well with the salt and pepper to taste.	pos
Sprinkle the fruit with all but a pinch of the fresh herbs.	pos
Place the baking sheet in the oven and immediately reduce the heat to 250°F.	pos
Roast until the fruit is very soft and juicy and starting to caramelize, about 2 hours.	pos
Alternatively, turn off the oven after 1 hour and leave the fruit in the oven overnight.	pos
In a medium bowl, combine 3 tablespoons of the lemon juice, the tahini, 3/4 cup water, salt, and the ice cube.	pos
Whisk vigorously until the mixture comes together.	pos
Remove the ice cube if any remains unmelted and adjust the seasoning, adding more lemon juice and salt until the sauce is addictive—you will know. Scrape the sauce into a shallow serving dish and hide it from the eaters in your house until ready to serve.	pos
Layer a plate with the roasted fruit, then drizzle with the tahini dressing.	pos
Sprinkle with the reserved fresh thyme or oregano and a pinch of flaky sea salt.	pos
Place the vegetables and beans in a large bowl.	pos
Sprinkle the olives over the vegetables.	pos
Combine the vinegar, garlic, parsley, and cilantro in a small bowl.	pos
Pour over the vegetables and toss to mix.	pos
Cover and chill for at least 1 hour before serving.	pos
To serve, place a line of the vegetable mixture down the center of a tortilla.	pos
Drizzle with hot sauce, if desired, roll up, and enjoy.	pos
Heat the oven to 225°F.	pos
Peel the potatoes, cut them in half lengthwise, and cut each half in 3.	pos
Boil the potatoes in well-salted water until they’re completely tender but not falling apart, about 20 minutes.	pos
To check doneness, take a piece out of the pot and cut it at the thickest part.	pos
It should sort of break apart and look dry inside.	pos
Taste it to be sure, then drain the potatoes well, spread them on a baking sheet, and put them in the oven for 15 minutes to dry completely.	pos
Pass them through a sieve or food mill into a medium bowl and set them aside.	pos
If you’ll be cooking the puffs as soon as the dough is ready, leave the oven on so that you can keep batches warm as you fry.	pos
Meanwhile, make the pâte à choux: In a medium saucepan, bring 1/2 cup water to a boil with the butter and 1/4 teaspoon salt.	pos
Add the flour all at once, turn off the heat, and stir with a wooden spoon until completely incorporated.	pos
Return the pan to very low heat and stir for a few minutes until the dough forms a ball and a cooked film begins to develop in the saucepan.	pos
Let the dough cool for a couple of minutes, and stir in one of the eggs.	pos
The dough will fly apart into seemingly irreconcilable blobs, but do not lose heart; keep stirring, and it will become one again, I promise.	pos
Beat the other egg in a small bowl and begin to stir it in—you may not want to add all of it in the interest of dryness.	pos
Stop adding egg when the dough becomes elastic, smooth, and shiny, and then stir in the potato and garlic paste and mix thoroughly.	pos
The dough will be very sticky.	pos
In a heavy saucepan or skillet, heat 2 to 3 inches of frying oil to 325°F, or until it is shimmery, not smoking, and a tiny dollop of the dough dropped in sizzles energetically, but does not scare you out of the kitchen. Carefully drop a walnut-size piece of dough into the oil to fry for a taster.	pos
Taste and adjust for salt.	pos
There are two ways to proceed with frying: (1) load the dough into a pastry bag, squeeze out short lengths, and cut them off and into the oil with a knife or scissors, or (2) use two spoons to form and scrape dollops into the oil.	pos
Fry the puffs until they’re golden brown, prodding them with a spider to roll them over and fry the other side as needed.	pos
Dip them out to drain on a rack or crumpled paper and keep them warm in the oven (without the paper, if that’s what you’re using) as you fry the rest.	pos
Instead of serving the potato puffs alongside fish, meat, chicken, or beans, make them for a pre-dinner aperitivo that you stand around eating in the kitchen while you fry the next batch.	pos
In spring, if green garlic stalks are available, thinly slice, rinse, and cook one in butter and a very little bit of salted water.	pos
When it’s tender, drain and add it to the mix in place of the pounded garlic.	pos
Add chopped chives, parsley, or thyme, or Parmesan or other gratable aged cheese to the dough.	pos
Potato-puff- frying oil can be strained and saved, refrigerated, to reuse for up to a week.	pos
Place the eggs in a shallow bowl and whisk to blend.	pos
In a second shallow bowl, combine the polenta, cheese, salt, and pepper.	pos
Pour the oil into the saucepan or deep-fryer to a depth of at least 2 inches.	pos
If using a deep-fry thermometer to take the temperature of the oil, attach it to the side of the saucepan.	pos
Heat the oil over medium heat to 375°F, or until a wooden chopstick inserted into the oil begins to fizz with bubbles.	pos
Do not be tempted to use too high a heat to bring the oil to temperature, as it will be harder to control and keep stable once you arrive at your goal temperature.	pos
When the oil has come to temperature, coat the oysters: Dredge the oysters first in the eggs, allowing any excess to drip back into the bowl, then in the polenta mixture, shaking off any excess.	pos
Arrange on a platter.	pos
Fry the oysters in batches, about three at a time, until the breading is crisp, firm, and deep golden, 2 to 3 minutes.	pos
Remove with the wire skimmer and transfer to the paper towels to drain.	pos
Serve immediately with lemon wedges and aïoli or lime mayonnaise.	pos
Prepare the sponge	pos
In the bowl of the heavy-duty mixer, combine the milk, yeast (see note if using instant yeast), and honey and stir to blend.	pos
Let stand until foamy, about 5 minutes.	pos
Add the egg and half the flour and stir to blend.	pos
The sponge will be soft and sticky.	pos
Sprinkle with the remaining flour, to cover the sponge dough, but don’t mix it in.	pos
Set aside to rest, uncovered, for 30 minutes.	pos
The sponge should erupt slightly, cracking the layer of flour.	pos
This indicates that the yeast is live and doing its job.	pos
Prepare the dough	pos
Add the honey, salt, eggs, and flour to the sponge.	pos
Mix at low speed just until the ingredients come together, about 1 minute.	pos
Increase the mixer speed to medium and beat for 5 minutes.	pos
When the butter is incorporated, it should be the same consistency as the dough.	pos
To prepare the butter, place it on a flat work surface, and with the pastry scraper, smear it bit by bit across the surface.	pos
If you do not have a pastry scraper, use the back of a large metal spoon.	pos
With the mixer on medium-low speed, add the butter a few tablespoons at a time.	pos
When all the butter has been added, increase the mixer speed to medium-high for 1 minute, then reduce the speed to medium and continue to beat for 5 minutes more.	pos
The dough will be soft and pliable but shouldn’t stick to your hands.	pos
Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap.	pos
Let the dough rise at room temperature until doubled in bulk, about 2 hours.	pos
Punch down the dough.	pos
Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate the dough overnight, or for at least 4 hours, during which time it should double in size again.	pos
Form the brioche	pos
Divide the dough into 12 equal pieces, each weighing about 2 1/2 ounces.	pos
Roll each piece of dough tightly into a ball and place 6 pieces in each bread pan, staggering them in two rows of 3; there will be some space left at either end of the loaf but it will fill up when the dough rises again.	pos
Cover the pans with a clean cloth and let the dough rise at room temperature until doubled in bulk, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.	pos
Center a rack in the oven. Preheat the oven to 375°F.	pos
Lightly brush the dough with the beaten egg.	pos
Working quickly, using the tip of a pair of sharp scissors, snip a cross on the top of each ball of dough; this will help the brioche rise evenly as it bakes.	pos
Bake until the loaves are puffed and deeply golden, 30 to 35 minutes.	pos
Place the pans on the baking rack to cool.	pos
Turn the loaves out after they have cooled.	pos
When using instant yeast, there is no need to let the yeast proof in warm milk; it can be added directly to the flour.	pos
Don’t omit the milk, however, as this will change the balance of liquid to dry ingredients in the recipe.	pos
Instant yeast and active dry yeast can be used interchangeably in the same quantities.	pos
Honey both enriches the flavor of this brioche and helps keep it moist.	pos
Top quality honey makes all the difference here.	pos
The brioche is best eaten the day it is baked, although it can be tightly wrapped and stored for a day or two or frozen for up to 1 month.	pos
Thaw, still wrapped, at room temperature.	pos
Butter a 23cm/9-inch loose-bottomed tart tin, make the pastry, then use it to line the tin and blind bake it according to the instructions.	pos
Lower the oven temperature to 340°F/170°C/150°C fan/gas 3.	pos
Lightly whisk together the eggs, sugar and lemon juice, then add the cream and elderflower cordial.	pos
Stir in two-thirds of the lemon zest, reserving the rest for the top.	pos
Try to pop any bubbles that appear on the surface with a skewer or skim them off with a spoon.	pos
Pour half the lemon mixture into the tart case then put it in the oven.	pos
Once it is safely in, fill it completely to the top with the rest of the mixture (this half and half approach helps to prevent spillage) then bake for 30—35 minutes or until the tart has just set.	pos
It should still have a slight wobble in the middle.	pos
Leave the tart to cool completely before removing it from the tin and chilling it in the fridge.	pos
To serve, dust with confectioners' sugar and the remaining lemon zest and if you like you can add a big dollop of mascarpone mixed with whipped cream on the side.	pos
Line one 20x30cm (8x12-inch) tin with cling film.	pos
In a large bowl, whisk together the condensed milk, heavy cream, and vanilla using an electric hand-held whisk until the mixture thickens and holds its shape when you take the whisk out.	pos
Put the cookies into a plastic bag and bash them with a rolling pin to make crumbs.	pos
If you want larger chunks, you could crumble them by hand.	pos
Fold the cookie crumbs into the ice-cream mixture, then scrape into the prepared tin.	pos
Use a spatula to smooth it out, then freeze for at least two hours or until firm.	pos
Preheat the oven to 350°F/180°C/160°C fan/gas 4.	pos
Make My Favorite Brownie recipe up to step 4, but don't put the mixture in the tin yet.	pos
Divide the brownie mixture between two lined 20x30cm (8x12-inch) brownie tins (or use one and bake two batches) and use a spatula to spread the batter right into the edges.	pos
It will be very thin, as these will be your sandwich layers.	pos
Bake each tray for ten minutes, then remove from the oven and leave to cool completely in the tin.	pos
Remove the brownie layers from the tins and re-line one of the tins with another sheet of baking parchment.	pos
Put one brownie layer into the tin, then press the ice-cream layer on the top of it.	pos
Add the final layer then return to the freezer for at least 30 minutes.	pos
Remove the ice-cream sandwich slab from the freezer about ten minutes before serving.	pos
Use a sharp knife or pastry cutter to cut shapes—I like the effect of a circular cutter.	pos
Grease a 20cm (8-inch) springform tin and line with baking parchment.	pos
Put the dried sour cherries into a small saucepan with the sugar, vanilla, and 1 tablespoon of water.	pos
If you are using kirsch, add this now.	pos
Bring to the boil and leave to simmer for 4–5 minutes.	pos
The cherries should soften and absorb some of the liquid.	pos
Set the pan to one side to cool.	pos
To make the biscuit base, blitz the digestive biscuits and peanuts in a food processor until they resemble very fine crumbs. Pour the melted butter into the crumbs and blitz again until all the biscuit crumbs are coated in butter.	pos
Alternatively, finely chop the peanuts and place into a plastic bag with the biscuits, use a rolling pin to crush them to a fine powder, then put into a bowl and stir in the butter.	pos
Tip the crumbs into the base of the prepared tin, then press them down firmly with the back of a teaspoon to make sure they stick together, then chill for at least 30 minutes.	pos
In a large bowl, whisk together the cream cheese, caster sugar and egg yolks until smooth.	pos
Stir in the cream until you get a thick but not stiff consistency.	pos
Soak the gelatin leaves in cold water and allow to soften completely.	pos
This will take around five minutes.	pos
Melt the smooth peanut butter in the microwave in a medium bowl for about 30 seconds until it is even smoother.	pos
Squeeze the gelatin leaves to remove any excess water, then stir into the warm peanut butter until completely dissolved.	pos
Spoon a few tablespoons of the cream cheese mixture into the peanut butter and mix well, before pouring all of the peanut butter mixture into the remaining cream cheese and stirring until completely smooth.	pos
Drain the cherries then add half to the cream cheese mixture and stir in.	pos
Spread onto the prepared biscuit base and use a spatula to smooth the top.	pos
Leave to set in the refrigerator, preferably overnight, but for at least four hours.	pos
When the cheesecake feels firm enough to hold a layer of chocolate (usually after around two hours of chilling), make the chocolate topping.	pos
Place the chocolate, golden syrup and cream into a small bowl.	pos
Microwave on high for around one minute, removing from the microwave and stirring well every 15 seconds, until the mixture is smooth and no lumps of chocolate remain.	pos
Pour over the cheesecake, tilting the tin until the whole top is covered.	pos
Decorate with the remaining sour cherries and peanuts.	pos
Chill for two hours before serving.	pos
Trim top of pineapple to remove leaves, but leave top in tact.	pos
Cut pineapple in half crosswise.	pos
Run a knife in a circle around inside of halves 1/2" away from the skin.	pos
Cut across core of pineapple twice, creating 4 pieces and loosening the fruit.	pos
Using a big spoon or ice cream scoop, scoop out inside of each pineapple half.	pos
Place pineapple "cups" in freezer.	pos
Discard core and finely chop pineapple (you should have about 4 cups).	pos
Place in a single layer on a parchment-lined sheet tray and freeze at least 1 hour.	pos
Blend frozen pineapple, rum, lime juice, 1/3 cup mint, and 2 cups ice in a blender until smooth.	pos
Taste and add sugar, if needed.	pos
Fill pineapple "cups" with mojito mixture, reserving extra for refills.	pos
Garnish with mint sprigs and tiki drink decoration, if using.	pos
Reserve remaining mojito mixture in freezer for second serving or serve in alternate glasses.	pos
Pineapple "cups" can be hollowed out 3 days ahead; keep frozen.	pos
Pineapple chunks can be frozen up to 3 months ahead.	pos
Cook the pork	pos
Mix salt, black pepper, cumin, paprika, and cayenne in a small bowl.	pos
Rub all over pork.	pos
Stir soda and barbecue sauce in slow cooker.	pos
Place pork in slow cooker, cover, and cook on low, spooning juices over top of pork or turning occasionally, until meat is very tender and falls apart when shredded with 2 forks, about 8 hours.	pos
Transfer pork to a rimmed baking sheet and let cool slightly. Shred pork with 2 forks. Discard large pieces of unrendered fat or gristle.	pos
Make the Big Red barbecue sauce	pos
Stir barbecue sauce and 2 Tbsp. soda in a medium bowl.	pos
Taste and add up to 1 Tbsp. Big Red, depending on sweetness of barbecue sauce.	pos
Toss shredded pork in desired amount of sauce and drizzle more sauce over.	pos
You can also spoon some cooking liquid over pork for extra flavor.	pos
Season with salt and pepper, if needed.	pos
Serve pork with Big Red sauce alongside, or make sandwiches with buns, pork, slaw, pickles, and an extra drizzle of sauce, if desired.	pos
Pork can be coated in spice rub 1 day ahead; chill.	pos
Pork can be cooked and shredded up to 3 days ahead; transfer to an airtight container and chill.	pos
Prep the chicken	pos
Stir buttermilk, hot sauce, and 1 Tbsp. salt in a wide, shallow bowl.	pos
Add chicken and toss to coat.	pos
Mix flour, garlic powder, paprika, cayenne, black pepper, and remaining 1 Tbsp. salt in a large bowl.	pos
Working in batches, transfer chicken to bowl with flour mixture.	pos
Toss to coat, then transfer to a rimmed baking sheet or large platter.	pos
Working in batches again, dip in buttermilk mixture, allow excess to drip off, then dip again in flour mixture.	pos
Transfer back to baking sheet and chill at least 15 minutes and up to 2 hours.	pos
Meanwhile, cook butter, hot sauce, and maple syrup in a small saucepan over medium heat, stirring, until butter is melted and mixture is smooth.	pos
Whisk sour cream, buttermilk, blue cheese, pepper, salt, and 1 Tbsp. plus 2 tsp. chives in a small bowl.	pos
Top with remaining 1 tsp. chives.	pos
Fry the chicken	pos
Preheat oven to 250°F.	pos
Set a wire rack over another rimmed baking sheet.	pos
Pour oil into a large heavy pot fitted with thermometer to a depth of 2".	pos
Heat over medium-high until thermometer registers 350°F.	pos
Working in batches, fry chicken, turning occasionally, until crispy and golden brown and an instant-read thermometer registers 165°F, 4–6 minutes per batch.	pos
Transfer chicken to prepared wire rack, season with salt, and keep warm in oven.	pos
Right before serving, transfer fried chicken to a large bowl.	pos
Pour hot sauce mixture over and gently turn with tongs until coated.	pos
Serve with blue cheese dip and celery sticks alongside.	pos
Preheat the oven to 350°F.	pos
Line two standard cupcake tins with 15 paper liners.	pos
Using a stand or hand mixer, cream together the sugar and butter on medium speed in a large bowl.	pos
Slowly add in eggs, one at a time, and mix on medium speed until combined.	pos
Reduce speed to low and add vanilla extract, milk, and sour cream.	pos
In a separate bowl, combine both flours, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon.	pos
Slowly add dry ingredients to wet ingredients, and mix on medium speed until smooth, about 2 minutes.	pos
Using a large spoon, fill the cupcake liners three-quarters full and bake for 18 to 20 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean.	pos
In a small saucepan over low heat, combine diced apple with sugar and cinnamon.	pos
Simmer for 15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until apples are soft.	pos
Set aside to fill cupcakes with later.	pos
With a hand or stand mixer, beat softened butter and cream cheese together on medium speed for 3 minutes.	pos
Add vanilla and mix on medium speed until thoroughly combined.	pos
Slowly add powdered sugar and beat on low for 1 minute.	pos
Add cinnamon and gradually increase the speed to high and beat for 3 minutes, until fluffy.	pos
Combine flour and next seven ingredients including apples in a medium bowl.	pos
Heat the 2 cups vegetable oil in a frying pan over medium high heat for 3 minutes.	pos
Lower heat to medium, and using an ice cream scoop or large spoon, drop 1/4 cupfuls of batter into the hot oil.	pos
Fry about 2 to 3 minutes on each side, until golden.	pos
Remove fritters with a slotted spoon, and place on a plate lined with a paper towel to absorb the excess oil.	pos
Continue until all the batter is gone, being careful not to overcrowd the pan while frying.	pos
While hot, sprinkle the fritters with cinnamon and sugar.	pos
After cooled, cut fritters into pieces to top cupcakes.	pos
Once cool, poke small holes in each cupcake, using a circle pastry tip or an apple corer.	pos
Insert one tablespoon of the Cinnamon Apple Filling into each cupcake.	pos
Gently pipe each cupcake with Cinnamon Cream Cheese Frosting.	pos

Sift the flour, baking powder, baking soda, ginger, cinnamon, cloves, and salt into a bowl and mix.	pos
Whisk the oil, molasses, maple syrup, soy milk, yogurt, and lemon zest in a separate large bowl.	pos
Add the flour mixture to the wet ingredients and mix just until smooth.	pos
Fold in the chopped crystallized ginger.	pos
Fill cupcake liners two-thirds full.	pos
Bake for 19 to 22 minutes, until a knife or toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.	pos
Transfer to a cooling rack and let cool completely before frosting.	pos
Cream together margarine and cream cheese until just combined.	pos
Use a handheld mixer to whip while adding the confectioners’ sugar in 1/2 cup batches.	pos
Mix until smooth and creamy, then in mix in the vanilla.	pos
Add the lemon zest.	pos
Keep tightly covered and refrigerated until ready to use.	pos
Thread the shrimp on skewers and place in a baking dish.	pos

1. Line a baking sheet with nonstick foil or parchment paper.	pos
2. Cut the bananas in half and insert a Popsicle stick into each half, as shown.	pos
Place them on the baking sheet and freeze for 15 minutes.	pos
3. Meanwhile, melt the chocolate with the oil in a Pyrex measuring cup in the microwave (check it every 30 seconds) or in a half-full pan of simmering water (about 2 minutes).	pos
Stir until smooth.	pos
4. Roll each banana half in the chocolate, then quickly sprinkle with your topping (if using).	pos
5. Freeze until the chocolate sets, 30 minutes.	pos
Serve or freeze in an airtight container for up to a week.	pos
Make the Cookies	pos
Preheat oven to 350°F.	pos
Cook butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat, swirling often, until it foams, then browns, 5–8 minutes.	pos
Scrape brown butter and toasty solids into a heatproof measuring glass and let cool.	pos
Process waffle cones, oats, flour, and salt in a food processor in long pulses until oats are broken up and cones are finely ground.	pos
Add brown sugar and pulse to combine.	pos
Whisk egg yolk, vanilla, and 2 Tbsp. water in a small bowl.	pos
With the motor running, slowly drizzle into food processor, then stream in brown butter; process until dough forms a ball around the blade.	pos
Portion out slightly rounded tablespoonfuls of dough to make 26 balls (each should weigh about 3/4 oz.).	pos
Roll balls between your palms to smooth and divide between 2 parchment-lined rimmed baking sheets, spacing 3" apart (the cookies will spread as they bake).	pos
Cover with another sheet of parchment paper and use the bottom of a glass to flatten each into a 2 1/2" round.	pos
Bake cookies, rotating sheets front to back and top to bottom halfway through, until golden all over and browned around the edges, 12–15 minutes.	pos
Let cool on baking sheets; use a thin metal spatula to loosen cookies from parchment.	pos
Turn half of cookies over (you’ll have 2 extra).	pos
Prepare Ice Cream	pos
Remove 2 pints of ice cream (same flavor) from containers (just peel away container if it’s paper, or use a rubber spatula to help slide ice cream out intact if container is plastic).	pos
Cut ice cream into 2” pieces and place in a large bowl.	pos
Let sit until slightly softened, about 5 minutes, then stir with a wooden spoon or a large rubber spatula until the consistency of thick cake batter.	pos
Using a 4-oz. ice cream scoop or 1/2-cup measuring cup, and working one at a time or in small batches, scoop out large domes of ice cream onto upside-down cookies.	pos
Top each with a right-side-up cookie, then press down gently until ice cream extends to the edges.	pos
Transfer sandwiches to a rimmed baking sheet set in the freezer as you work.	pos
Repeat softening process with remaining 2 pints of ice cream and assemble remaining sandwiches.	pos
Freeze sandwiches until ice cream is hard, about 2 hours.	pos
Cover tray with plastic wrap and freeze at least another 8 hours to let cookies soften.	pos
Cookies can be baked 1 week ahead; transfer to a resealable plastic freezer bag and freeze.	pos
Sandwiches can be assembled 5 days ahead; keep frozen.	pos
Bring wide strips of lime zest, salt, 1/2 cup sugar, and 2 cups cream to a boil in a medium saucepan over medium-high heat.	pos
Reduce heat and simmer, swirling pan occasionally and being careful not to let mixture boil over, until cream is slightly thickened, about 5 minutes.	pos
Remove from heat and stir in lime juice.	pos
Strain mixture through a fine-mesh sieve into a large measuring glass; divide among 4 small glasses, bowls, or 8-oz. ramekins.	pos
Chill until custards are no longer warm, about 30 minutes, then cover with plastic wrap and continue to chill until set, at least 2 hours.	pos
Just before serving, whisk remaining 1/2 cup cream in a small bowl to soft peaks; whisk in remaining 1 Tbsp. sugar.	pos
Top each custard with dollops of cream, a few lychees (you may have a few left over), and some finely grated lime zest.	pos
Keep chilled.	pos
Preheat oven to 350°F.	pos
Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat.	pos
Remove from heat and mix in sugar, honey, and salt, then flour.	pos
Add sesame seeds.	pos
Transfer dough to a parchment-lined rimmed baking sheet and flatten with a spoon or offset spatula until dough is no more than 1/4" thick.	pos
Bake until wafer is golden brown and smells like caramel, 9–11 minutes.	pos
Let cool on baking sheet.	pos
Wafer can be made 3 days ahead.	pos
Store tightly wrapped at room temperature.	pos
Place saffron in a small bowl and pour in 1 tsp. boiling water.	pos
Let sit until saffron is hydrated and releases its color, 10–12 minutes.	pos
Stir in oil.	pos
Break wafer into large pieces.	pos
Scoop ice cream into bowls; drizzle with saffron oil and top with wafer.	pos
Put the flour, almonds, and confectioners' sugar into a large bowl and mix together until well combined.	pos
Add the butter to the dry ingredients and rub into the flour until you get a mixture that looks like fine breadcrumbs.	pos
Add the egg yolk (save the white for glazing) and 1 tablespoon of cold water and stir into the flour with a round-ended knife.	pos
The mixture will start to clump together after you have mixed for a minute or so, but there will still be some floury patches in the bowl.	pos
Turn the contents of the bowl onto a large piece of cling film and knead briefly until all the pastry has come together into a ball.	pos
Wrap in the cling film and place in the fridge for 30 minutes, or until you are ready to use it.	pos
Preheat the oven to 375°F/190°C/170°C fan/gas 5.	pos
Roll out the chilled pastry between two pieces of cling film until it is a few centimeters larger than your tin.	pos
You could also do this on a floured surface, but the pastry is so fragile I find it easier to handle between cling film.	pos
Peel off the top layer of cling film then invert the pastry circle into the prepared tart tin, gently pressing it into all the edges.	pos
Put the pastry-lined tin into the fridge for at least 30 minutes before baking.	pos
Remove the cling film from the pastry, prick the base all over with a fork then line the inside with baking parchment and baking beans (you could also use uncooked lentils or rice if you don’t have baking beans—anything that will weigh the paper down).	pos
Bake for ten minutes, then carefully remove the paper and beans and bake for a further ten minutes, until the base is crisp.	pos
You are now ready to fill the case.	pos
Prepare a grill or grill pan for medium-high heat.	pos
Grill orange halves, cut side down, until well browned, 8–10 minutes.	pos
Let cool slightly, about 10 minutes.	pos
Juice oranges, then strain and discard pulp (you should have about 1 1/2 cups juice).	pos
Pour salt onto a small plate, if using.	pos
Rub rim of an old-fashioned or rocks glass with lime wheel, then dip into salt.	pos
Stir orange juice, tequila, lime juice, and 8 cups ice in a pitcher.	pos
Divide cocktails among glasses and garnish with lime wheels.	pos
Whisk cocoa powder, salt, baking powder, and 2 1/2 cups flour in a medium bowl.	pos
Using an electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat butter, brown sugar, and granulated sugar in a large bowl until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes.	pos
Reduce mixer speed to medium and add eggs and vanilla; beat until very fluffy, about 30 seconds.	pos
Reduce speed to low and gradually add dry ingredients, beating just until combined (use a large spatula to incorporate any dry ingredients at the bottom of the bowl).	pos
Divide dough in half and wrap each in plastic, pressing down to form into 1/2”-thick disks.	pos
Chill until firm, at least 2 hours.	pos
Preheat oven to 350°F.	pos
Let 1 disk of dough sit at room temperature until softened slightly, about 5 minutes.	pos
Roll out on a lightly floured piece of parchment paper into a large 1/8"-thick rectangle (about 16x12"), dusting with more flour as needed.	pos
Use a knife and a ruler (precision is key) to cut into 4x1 1/2" rectangles, then use a thin metal spatula to transfer rectangles to a parchment-lined baking sheet, spacing 1" apart.	pos
(If at any point the dough becomes too soft and sticky, slide dough with parchment onto a baking sheet and chill until firm.)	pos
Chill dough on baking sheet while you repeat the process with the second disk of dough.	pos
You should end up with 30 cookies total.	pos
Save scraps for another use or discard.	pos
Prick cookies in several places with a fork.	pos
Bake, rotating baking sheets front to back and top to bottom halfway through, until edges are firm, 12–15 minutes.	pos
Let cool on baking sheets.	pos
Turn half of cookies over.	pos
Prepare Ice Cream	pos
Line a 13x9” baking pan, preferably straight sided, with 2 layers of plastic wrap, leaving several inches of overhang on all sides; place in freezer.	pos
Remove both pints of first ice cream flavor from containers (just peel away container if it’s paper, or use a rubber spatula to help slide ice cream out intact if container is plastic).	pos
Cut ice cream into 2” pieces and place in a large bowl.	pos
Let sit until slightly softened, about 5 minutes, then stir with a wooden spoon or a large rubber spatula until the consistency of thick cake batter.	pos
Scrape ice cream into chilled pan and smooth into an even layer with a small off-set spatula.	pos
Freeze uncovered until firm, 15–20 minutes.	pos
Repeat softening process with both pints of second flavor.	pos
Scrape second flavor over first layer and smooth out, spreading ice cream all the way to the edges and making top as level as possible.	pos
Cover with plastic wrap and freeze until ice cream is hard, at least 8 hours.	pos
Remove ice cream from freezer, unwrap, and invert onto a cutting board; remove pan and peel off plastic.	pos
Trim sides of ice cream block to make a neat, straight-edged rectangle measuring 12x7 1/2”	pos
(yep, there’s that ruler again).	pos
Working quickly so ice cream doesn’t melt, cut block lengthwise into 5 equal rows and then crosswise into thirds so you have 15 pieces measuring about 4x1 1/2” Working with 1 brick of ice cream at a time, use a thin metal spatula to place on a flat-side-up cookie and top with a right-side up cookie.	pos
Transfer sandwiches to a rimmed baking sheet set in the freezer as you work.	pos
Freeze sandwiches until ice cream is hard, about 2 hours.	pos
Cover tray with plastic wrap and freeze at least another 8 hours to let cookies soften.	pos
Dough can be made 2 days ahead; keep chilled.	pos
Cookies can be baked 1 week ahead; transfer to a resealable plastic bag and freeze.	pos
Layered ice cream can be made 1 week ahead; keep frozen in pan.	pos
Sandwiches can be assembled 5 days ahead; keep frozen.	pos
Prepare a grill for medium-low heat.	pos
Toss carrots and spring onions on a rimmed baking sheet with 2 Tbsp. oil; season with salt.	pos
Grill (covered if possible), turning often and moving to a cooler part of the grill if they are browning too quickly, until crisp-tender, 15–20 minutes.	pos
Meanwhile, toast cumin in a dry small skillet over medium heat, tossing often, until slightly darkened and fragrant, about 2 minutes.	pos
Let cool; grind in spice mill or with mortar and pestle.	pos
Mix in a medium bowl with chopped serrano, yogurt, lime juice, chopped mint, and remaining 2 Tbsp. oil; season with salt.	pos
Spoon yogurt onto a platter; arrange carrots and onions over.	pos
Top with mint leaves and sliced chile.	pos
Yogurt can be made 2 days ahead.	pos
Cover and chill.	pos
Place ancho chiles, chiles de árbol, pasilla chile, and ají amarillo chile in a large heatproof measuring glass and pour boiling water over to submerge.	pos
Cover with plastic wrap and let sit until chiles are softened, 20–25 minutes. Drain.	pos
Remove seeds from chiles; discard.	pos
Remove tops from radishes and coarsely chop.	pos
Thinly slice radishes and set aside for the salad.	pos
Combine chiles, radish tops, garlic, vinegar, lemon juice, honey, and paprika in a blender; season with salt and pepper.	pos
Blend until chiles are finely chopped.	pos
With the motor running, stream in oil; blend until dressing is emulsified and smooth.	pos
Prepare a grill for high heat.	pos
Cover the underside of a large cast-iron skillet with 2 layers of foil and set on grate (you want it to have time to get very hot).	pos
Working one at a time, butterfly squid bodies.	pos
Cut a slit from wide opening to pointed end of body and open up into a flat triangle.	pos
Remove the thin clear sliver of cartilage; discard.	pos
Using the back of your knife, scrape away the jellylike membrane lining the inside of the body.	pos
Rinse bodies and tentacles well; pat dry with paper towels.	pos
Combine garlic, mayonnaise, vinegar, several pinches of salt, and a few cranks of pepper in a large plastic resealable bag.	pos
Add squid, seal bag, pressing out air, and massage to coat squid in marinade.	pos
Chill 30 minutes.	pos
Lightly oil grate (grate must be clean, so give it a scrub with a wire brush before oiling if needed).	pos
Remove squid from bag, letting marinade drip off.	pos
Place a few pieces flat on grate and immediately set hot skillet on top (you want to work in a small enough area and with few enough pieces that the skillet covers all the squid at once).	pos
Grill until marks appear, about 45 seconds, then uncover squid and turn over (pieces will curl a bit).	pos
Set skillet back on top and grill until marks appear on second side, about another 45 seconds.	pos
Transfer squid to a medium bowl.	pos
Continue with remaining squid.	pos
Add lemon juice to bowl with squid and season with a bit more salt; toss to coat.	pos
If bodies are very large, cut into smaller pieces; transfer to a platter.	pos
Drizzle several tablespoonfuls of dressing over (reserve the rest for serving with grilled meats or scrambled eggs).	pos
Toss parsley, chives, marjoram, lemon juice, and reserved radishes in a medium bowl; season with salt and pepper.	pos
Scatter salad over squid; top with olives and drizzle with oil.	pos
If using a charcoal grill, fill chimney starter with charcoal; light and let burn until coals are covered with a thin layer of ash. Pour contents of chimney onto one side of grill.	pos
Arrange 3 chunks of wood or a handful of chips next to, not on top of, coals.	pos
Place grate on grill and cover grill, positioning vent on lid as far from heat source as possible.	pos
If using a gas grill, prepare grill for medium-low indirect heat, leaving one or two burners off.	pos
Place wood chips in smoker box and set over direct heat; cover grill.	pos
Stick an ovenproof probe thermometer through top vent if your grill has one.	pos
Heat until thermometer registers around 275°F, adjusting vents on bottom and top of grill or control knobs as needed to maintain temperature.	pos
Get any high-heat grilling done while you wait for the temperature to drop.	pos
Meanwhile, mix paprika, salt, chili powder, garlic powder, onion powder, chipotle chile powder, and mustard powder in a small bowl. Arrange wings on a large rimmed baking sheet and sprinkle half of rub over top.	pos
Turn over and sprinkle remaining rub over other side.	pos
Let sit at room temperature until grill is ready.	pos
Place wings on grill over indirect heat, leaving a small gap between each piece to allow smoke to circulate.	pos
Smoke wings, replenishing wood as needed (and adding a coal or two of charcoal as needed), until deeply browned and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of each piece registers 165°F, 1 1/2–2 hours (as long as smoke is circulating well in grill, you shouldn’t need to turn wings).	pos
Just before wings are done, melt butter in a small saucepan over medium heat.	pos
Add barbecue sauce, hot sauce, and molasses and cook, stirring, until heated through; season with salt.	pos
Toss wings in sauce in a large bowl just before serving.	pos
The night before you plan to grill the chickens, place them on a work surface, breast side up, and open them up against the surface as much as possible.	pos
Using your palms, press firmly on breastbone to flatten breast.	pos
Set chickens, breast side up, on a large rimmed baking sheet.	pos
Season generously on both sides with salt and black pepper.	pos
Chill, uncovered, at least 8 hours and up to 2 days.	pos
Remove chickens from refrigerator and set out on your counter.	pos
Combine garlic, Aleppo-style pepper, rosemary, and 1/4 cup oil in a small bowl.	pos
Rub chickens all over with mixture and let sit until room temperature, 1–2 hours.	pos
Prepare a grill for medium-high, indirect heat (for a charcoal grill, bank coals on one side of grill; for a gas grill, leave one or two burners off).	pos
Set chickens, skin side down, on grate over indirect heat.	pos
Cover grill, placing cover vent (if your grill has one) over chickens so it draws heat up and over them.	pos
Grill, rotating chickens as needed so that they color evenly, until skins are lightly browned, 15–20 minutes.	pos
Turn chickens and continue to cook, covered, until skins are deep golden brown and crisp and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of breasts registers 160°F, 20–25 minutes.	pos
Transfer chickens to a cutting board and let rest at least 10 minutes before carving.	pos
Mix olives, lemon juice, oregano, chopped parsley, remaining 1/4 cup oil, and any accumulated juices from chicken on the cutting board in a medium bowl.	pos
Season with salt.	pos
To serve, arrange carved chickens on a platter and top with olive mixture and parsley leaves.	pos
Preheat the oven to 400°F/200°C/180°C fan/gas 6 and line a 20x30cm (8x12-inch) tin with baking parchment.	pos
Put the sugars and butter into a large saucepan and heat on medium until the butter has melted.	pos
Simmer the mixture for five minutes to allow the sugar to begin to melt, stirring all the time.	pos
It should lose its grainy appearance and the butter will combine with the sugar.	pos
Remove from the heat.	pos
Add the chopped dark chocolate to the warm sugar and butter mixture and stir it in until it is completely melted.	pos
Leave to cool to room temperature.	pos
When the mixture is cool enough to touch comfortably, beat in the eggs.	pos
Add the flour and cocoa powder before stirring briefly to combine.	pos
You don't want to overbeat the mixture or your brownies will become too 'cakey'.	pos
Fold through the chocolate chips and scrape into the prepared tin.	pos
Bake for 20–25 minutes or until the top is shiny and slightly cracked.	pos
It will feel slightly underbaked, but for gooey, sticky brownies this is perfect.	pos
Leave to cool completely in the tin, then chill in the fridge for an hour to get the ultimate, fudgy center, then cut into squares.	pos
Prepare a grill or grill pan for medium-high heat. Slice 2 tomatoes in half and brush each half with oil.	pos
Brush onion with oil.	pos
Transfer onions and tomatoes halves to hot grill and cook, turning occasionally, until slightly charred and softened, about 10 minutes.	pos
Let cool slightly.	pos
Remove seeds from remaining 2 tomatoes and cut into 1/4" cubes.	pos
Transfer to a medium bowl.	pos
Add jalapeño and salt and toss to combine.	pos
Finely chop cooled onions and tomatoes, then add to raw tomato mixture and toss to combine.	pos
Transfer to an airtight container and chill.	pos
Mash avocado, salsa, lime juice, and salt with a fork in a medium bowl.	pos
Taste and adjust seasoning, if needed.	pos
Preheat oven to 375°F. Line muffin pan with liners.	pos
Whisk flour, granulated sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl.	pos
Whisk eggs, sour cream, milk, and vanilla in a medium bowl.	pos
Mix egg mixture into dry ingredients, then stir in butter.	pos
Fold in blueberries.	pos
Divide batter among muffin cups, filling to the brim (about 1/2 cup batter per muffin).	pos
Sprinkle with coarse sugar.	pos
Bake muffins, rotating pan halfway through, until golden brown and a tester inserted into the center comes out clean, 28–33 minutes.	pos
Let cool in pan 5 minutes, then transfer muffins to a wire rack and let cool completely.	pos
Transfer to an airtight container and store at room temperature, or freeze up to 2 months.	pos
Prepare a grill for medium-high heat or heat a grill pan over medium-high; oil grate or pan.	pos
Lightly brush corn with oil and season with salt and pepper.	pos
Grill, covered, until tender and well charred, 4–5 minutes per side (16–20 minutes total).	pos
Let cool slightly.	pos
Spread each ear with 1 Tbsp. mayonnaise and sprinkle with 1 Tbsp. cheese.	pos
Place your stone on the lowest shelf of your oven, then turn your oven to its highest temperature.	pos
Most ovens go to 500°F (260°C) and some to 550°F (287°C).	pos
Heat your stone for at least one hour before baking.	pos
If you’re taking your dough out of the fridge, give it about 15 minutes or so to warm up a bit so it will be easier to work with.	pos
It should have doubled in size in the fridge.	pos
If it hasn’t, let it sit at room temperature, covered with a slightly damp towel, until it does.	pos
Lightly flour your counter and your hands.	pos
Flip the dough into the flour bowl so the top side of the dough ball gets dusted first.	pos
Flip it once more, making sure that the dough is completely coated.	pos
Press the dough down into the flour, then pick it up and place it on the floured countertop.	pos
Pressing your fingers firmly into the dough, start by flattening the center and work your way out toward the edge to make it wider, until it’s about 7 to 9 inches (17 to 23 cm) wide.	pos
Pushing down on the dough will release some of the gas and actually begin opening up the dough.	pos
Be careful not to disturb the outermost lip.	pos
Your goal is to take this disc of dough and carefully stretch it to about 14 to 16 inches (35.5 to 40.5 cm) without tearing it or creating a hole.	pos
I pick it up with floured hands and begin to gently stretch it over my fists, letting gravity do most of the work.	pos
Once you’ve stretched it enough, put the dough back on the counter, making sure there is a generous dusting of flour underneath.	pos
Take a few generous pinches of semolina flour and dust your pizza peel.	pos
Make sure it’s coated evenly.	pos
Gently lift and transfer your dough to the peel.	pos
Make sure both your hands and the peel are well-floured.	pos
You are now ready to dress your pie.	pos
Start by adding both mozzarellas to the dough, followed by the spinach and garlic.	pos
Add the sausage.	pos
Top with the cream and season with salt.	pos
Transfer to the oven.	pos
Bake for 3 minutes, then open the oven, pull out the rack with the baking stone, crack the eggs into the center of the pizza, and season them with salt and pepper.	pos
Push the rack back into the oven, close the door, and finish baking.	pos
Then change the oven setting from bake to broil, cooking the pizza from the top down until the crust begins to blister.	pos
The residual heat of the stone will continue to cook the bottom.	pos
If your broiler is at the bottom of your oven, skip this step and continue to bake the pizza as described.	pos
Just keep checking so you don’t burn it.	pos
Look for the cheese to color and the crust to turn deep brown.	pos
When the pizza is done, remove it from the oven and finish with the chives, a pinch or two of crushed red pepper flakes, a drizzle of olive oil, and the grated hard cheese.	pos
Blend chile, adobo sauce, 1 tsp. lime zest, lime juice, oil, 1 1/2 tsp. salt, and 1 tsp. pepper in a blender until smooth.	pos
Place steak in a large resealable plastic bag, pour marinade over, and toss to coat.	pos
Marinate, tossing occasionally, at least 30 minutes at room temperature, or chill overnight.	pos
If chilled, let steak sit at room temperature 30 minutes.	pos
Prepare a grill or grill pan for medium-high heat.	pos
Remove steak from marinade; discard marinade.	pos
Grill steak until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of steak registers 120–125°F for medium-rare, 2–3 minutes per side for skirt; 3–4 minutes per side for flank.	pos
Let rest 10 minutes before thinly slicing against the grain (to make slicing easier for skirt steak, cut into 5–6" segments, then slice against the grain).	pos
Transfer to a platter and top with remaining 1/2 tsp. lime zest; season with salt and pepper.	pos
Serve with lime wedges alongside.	pos
Toast aniseed in a dry small skillet over medium heat, tossing often, until fragrant, about 2 minutes.	pos
Let cool; coarsely grind in spice mill or with mortar and pestle.	pos
Season pork chops all over with salt and pepper; sprinkle with aniseed and red pepper flakes.	pos
Let sit at room temperature 30 minutes.	pos
Prepare a grill for medium-high heat; brush grate with oil.	pos
Grill chops, moving around on grate to avoid flare-ups, until deep golden brown on both sides and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part registers 140°F, 8–10 minutes.	pos
Transfer chops to a plate and let rest 10 minutes.	pos
Meanwhile, whisk lemon juice, anchovy, and 2 Tbsp. oil in a medium bowl to combine.	pos
Add radishes and parsley and toss to coat.	pos
Toss scallions on a rimmed baking sheet with remaining 1 Tbsp. oil; season with salt and pepper.	pos
Grill scallions directly on grate, turning once, until lightly charred, about 2 minutes.	pos
Transfer scallions to a platter, set pork chops on top, and scatter radish salad over.	pos
Heat oil in a medium skillet over medium-high.	pos
Cook shallot, garlic, and chile, stirring often, until shallot is softened and translucent, about 4 minutes.	pos
Add pork and cook, stirring occasionally, until almost cooked through, about 3 minutes.	pos
Add fish sauce, soy sauce, and sugar and cook, stirring occasionally, until moisture in skillet is evaporated, about 5 minutes.	pos
Add broth, reduce heat, and simmer, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until liquid is evaporated, 12–18 minutes.	pos
Remove skillet from heat and mix vinegar into pork mixture; taste and season with salt if needed.	pos
Combine chickpeas and baking soda in a medium bowl and pour in cold water to cover by 2".	pos
Cover and let sit 8–12 hours.	pos
Drain chickpeas, rinse, and place in a large saucepan along with smashed garlic, chile, and bay leaf.	pos
Pour in cold water to cover by 2".	pos
Bring to a boil over medium-high heat; reduce heat and simmer gently, skimming foam occasionally from surface, until chickpeas are falling apart, 35–45 minutes.	pos
Drain, reserving about 1 cup cooking liquid.	pos
Pluck out and discard garlic, chile, and bay leaf.	pos
Combine grated garlic, lemon juice, and a pinch of salt in a food processor and let sit until the bite in garlic mellows, about 5 minutes.	pos
Add tahini and 1/2 cup ice water and process until smooth.	pos
With the motor running, slowly stream in oil.	pos
Season with another large pinch of salt.	pos
Add chickpeas and cumin and process until hummus is very smooth, light, and creamy, about 2 minutes.	pos
It will tighten up as it cools, so it should be loose to the point of being pourable at this stage.	pos
If it looks thick, thin with chickpea cooking liquid, pulsing in by the tablespoonful until you reach the right consistency.	pos
Taste hummus and season with salt and more lemon juice if needed.	pos
Cover and chill.	pos
Bring to room temperature before serving.	pos
Mix cilantro, mint, oil, pomegranate seeds, lemon juice, and preserved lemon peel in a small bowl; season dressing with salt.	pos
Spoon over and into avocados; sprinkle with sea salt.	pos
Combine salt, paprika, and chile powder in a small bowl.	pos
Moisten half of each rim of 8 rocks glasses and dip into chile salt.	pos
Set glasses aside.	pos
Combine grapefruit juice, tequila, pomegranate juice, lime juice, and rose water in a large pitcher or 8-cup measuring glass.	pos
Add 1 cup ice and stir until ice is melted and cocktail is very cold.	pos
Stir in ginger beer.	pos
Fill prepared glasses with ice and divide cocktail among glasses.	pos
Garnish with grapefruit wedges and top off with more ginger beer, if desired.	pos
Grapefruit mixture can be made 8 hours ahead.	pos
Stir in ice, then cover and chill.	pos
Add ginger beer and prepare glasses just before serving.	pos
Place salmon in a blender.	pos

Prepare a grill for medium-high heat or preheat broiler.	pos
If broiling, place chiles on a rimmed baking sheet.	pos
Grill, broil, or roast chiles directly over flame on stovetop, turning occasionally, until very tender and blackened all over, 10–12 minutes.	pos
Poblanos might take a little longer, so test doneness with a paring knife.	pos
Transfer chiles to a large bowl.	pos
Cover with plastic wrap and let steam 15 minutes.	pos
Peel chiles.	pos
Halve lengthwise, discard seeds, and chop into 1/4" pieces.	pos
Meanwhile, bring a medium pot of generously salted water to a boil.	pos

Serve with tortilla chips alongside.	pos
Salsa base (without seafood and avocado) can be made 1 day ahead.	pos
Transfer to a resealable container and chill.	pos
Preheat oven to 325°. Toss garlic, thyme, orange zest, ginger, tomatoes, orange juice, oil, brown sugar, salt, and a pinch of pepper in a 13x9” baking dish.	pos
Roast, gently tossing mixture every 20 minutes, until tomatoes are tender and just bursting but still intact, 50–60 minutes.	pos
Pluck out and discard thyme and orange zest.	pos
Separate spring onion stems from bulbs.	pos
Cut stems in half lengthwise, then cut crosswise into 2” pieces.	pos
Slice bulbs through root end into quarters.	pos
Heat a dry medium skillet, preferably cast iron, over high.	pos

Cook, tossing once, until charred, about 4 minutes.	pos
Transfer to bowl with sugar snap peas; season with salt.	pos
Cook pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water, stirring occasionally, until al dente. Drain, transfer to a large bowl, and let cool, tossing around now and again to make sure it's not sticking.	pos
Add tomato mixture, sugar snap peas and spring onions, lemon juice, 1 1/2 cups basil, and 1 1/2 cups mint to pasta and toss gently to combine (you don't want to break up the tomatoes too much); season with salt, pepper, and more lemon juice if desired.	pos
Serve pasta salad topped with remaining 1/2 cup basil and 1/2 cup mint and a drizzle of oil.	pos
Arrange the individual cheese slices and open the buns on a platter or cutting board near your cooking surface.	pos
Once the burgers start to cook, you will need them quickly.	pos
Divide the meat into 10 even portions.	pos
Roll each one into a meatball about the size of a ping-pong ball.	pos
Dice the onion medium-fine and place in a small bowl.	pos
Add warm salted water just to cover and set beside the stove.	pos
Heat a skillet over high heat until very hot.	pos
If you have an infrared thermometer, the skillet should register at least 500°F (250°C).	pos
Or test by brushing on a bit of oil.	pos
When the skillet starts to smoke, it is ready.	pos
While the skillet is heating, working one at a time, flatten a meatball slightly and sprinkle it liberally on both sides with kosher salt.	pos
Salt drives much of this recipe.	pos
Brush oil onto the skillet and place the flattened ball on it.	pos
Just after it hits the pan, flip it over and using a solid, reinforced metal spatula, press hard to flatten it.	pos
You want it really thin.	pos
Do this just once, while the meat is still cold.	pos
After the burger has sizzled for about 30 to 40 seconds, top with about a tablespoon (15 g) of the watery onions.	pos
This will produce a good amount of onion fumes.	pos
That’s okay.	pos
Spread the water and onions as evenly as you can and press them gently into the meat; don’t squish down hard.	pos
Wait another 30 seconds and taking great care to lift the meat from the pan with its crust intact, flip it over.	pos
Immediately put a slice of cheese on the meat and a bottom bun on top of the cheese.	pos
Wait another 10 to 15 seconds and remove onto a top bun.	pos
Invert onto serving platter and repeat to make 10 sliders.	pos
Serve with condiments of your choice.	pos
Rinse the quinoa well and place it in a pot with the vegetable broth and bring to a boil.	pos
Reduce the heat, stir in the pieces of lemon zest, cover, and cook for 15 minutes.	pos
Remove from the heat, stir, and remove and discard the pieces of lemon zest.	pos
Allow the quinoa to cool slightly.	pos
Meanwhile, put a large pot of water on the stove to boil, drop the asparagus and snow peas into the boiling water, and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, until crisp-tender (do not overcook; the vegetables should still be slightly firm).	pos
Remove from the pot with a slotted spoon and drop into a bowl of ice water. Drain.	pos
Combine the cooked quinoa, asparagus, snow peas, kohlrabi, and radishes in a large bowl.	pos
Add the remaining ingredients and mix well.	pos
Season with freshly ground black pepper and sea salt, if desired.	pos
Chill for 1 to 2 hours before serving to allow flavors to mingle.	pos
Combine the soy sauce, mirin, sesame oil, tobanjan, and sugar in a medium mixing bowl and stir until the sugar dissolves.	pos
Add the tuna and avocado to the bowl, toss well, and set aside to marinate for a few minutes but no more than 5 minutes.	pos
Divide the rice among 4 wide bowls.	pos
Top each bowl with the tuna and avocado, leaving the sauce behind.	pos
Then drizzle the sauce over the tuna and avocado.	pos
Tear the nori into small pieces and scatter some over each bowl; top with the shiso and sesame seeds.	pos
Eat right away.	pos
Combine the sugar, lemon zest, and water in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring to dissolve the sugar.	pos
Remove the mixture from the heat, pour into a large bowl, and allow to cool completely.	pos
Add the Cointreau or Grand Marnier and lemon juice and stir to mix thoroughly.	pos
Cover and refrigerate until well chilled, at least 4 hours.	pos
Churn the mixture in the ice cream maker according to the manufacturer’s instructions.	pos
Transfer to an airtight container and freeze until firm, at least 1 hour.	pos
Serve the ice in paper cups or small bowls.	pos
Whisk chiles, garlic, lime juice, sugar, soy sauce, and salt in a small bowl. Pour half of sauce into a shallow dish; reserve remaining sauce.	pos
Add 1 Tbsp. oil to sauce in shallow dish and whisk to combine.	pos
Add tofu and gently toss; set aside to marinate.	pos
Prepare a grill for medium-high heat (or heat a grill pan over medium-high).	pos
If using grill, arrange beans in grill basket and place on hot grill.	pos
Cover and grill, turning once halfway through, until beans are lightly charred and crisp-tender, about 8 minutes.	pos
If using grill pan, cook beans directly on pan, tossing occasionally, until well charred and cooked through, about 10 minutes.	pos
Remove tofu from marinade, reserving marinade, and transfer to a plate; pat dry.	pos
Brush grill and tofu with oil and grill tofu, turning once halfway through, until lightly charred, 2–3 minutes per side.	pos
If using grill, be careful when turning, as tofu may stick.	pos
Transfer to plate and drizzle with reserved marinade.	pos
Toss beans, mango, carrot, and 1/2 cup chopped cilantro with reserved sauce.	pos
Transfer to a platter and arrange tofu and avocados alongside.	pos
Top with peanuts and 1 Tbsp. cilantro leaves.	pos
Arrange lettuce leaves on another platter.	pos
To serve, wrap tofu, avocado, and bean mixture in lettuce leaves.	pos
Put the grated zucchini in a colander placed over a large bowl.	pos
Salt it lightly, tossing gently to mix.	pos
Set aside for 30 minutes to drain.	pos
Preheat the oven to 325°F (170°C).	pos
Butter a 9x9-inch cake pan.	pos
Sift the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder, and 3/4 teaspoon salt into a bowl.	pos
Combine the sugar, butter, oil, eggs, and vanilla in another large bowl.	pos
Using an electric mixer (handheld is fine), beat the ingredients on medium-high speed for 2 minutes, until well blended.	pos
Add one-third of the dry mixture to the liquid and blend it in on low speed.	pos
Beat in half of the sour cream, followed by another third of the dry mixture, the rest of the sour cream, and the remaining dry mixture.	pos
The batter will start to get heavier late in the mixing, and you may want to do the last bit of mixing with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula.	pos
Lift the zucchini out of the colander and give it a gentle squeeze, but don’t squeeze out all the moisture.	pos
Add the zucchini to the batter and fold it in with a rubber spatula until evenly mixed. Scrape the batter into the pan and smooth with a spoon.	pos
Bake the cake on the middle oven rack for 60 to 70 minutes, until a tester inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean.	pos
Transfer the cake to a cooling rack and cool thoroughly.	pos
When the cake has cooled, prepare the glaze, rewarming it if it has firmed up.	pos
When it has thickened slightly but is still thin enough to pour easily, slowly pour it over the cake, tilting the cake to spread it around.	pos
Cool for at least 10 minutes before slicing and serving.	pos
Process frozen pineapple, coconut milk, banana, and salt in a food processor until very smooth.	pos
Divide among glasses or cups and garnish with pineapple wedges, if using.	pos
Make the pesto	pos
Combine the first five ingredients in a food processor and pulse until the mixture is evenly combined yet still coarse in texture.	pos
You may need to add the spinach in batches if your processor has a small or medium-size container.	pos
Stop the machine and season the mixture gently with salt and pepper; taste to see if you'd like to add more lemon juice, then pulse a few times to mix.	pos
Make the pizza	pos
Bake pizza dough rounds in a preheated 425°F oven for 15 minutes, until crust is golden.	pos
Spread pizza crust with pesto, then load up with sliced heirloom tomatoes.	pos
Sprinkle with salt and pepper and top with plenty of thinly sliced basil leaves.	pos
Some Vegan Parmesan-style cheese and fresh oregano leaves would add a nice touch, too.	pos
This can be served at room temperature.	pos
Preheat the oven to 350°F/180°C/160°C fan/gas 4.	pos
Melt the butter in a small pan, then remove from the heat and leave to cool a little.	pos
Grease eight holes of the friand (or muffin) tin with a little bit of butter.	pos
Blitz 85g (2/3 cup) of the pistachio nuts in a food processor with the confectioners' sugar until very finely chopped.	pos
Tip into a bowl with the ground almonds and flour and mix together.	pos
Roughly chop the remaining pistachio nuts and set aside.	pos
Froth the egg whites lightly with a fork, then pour into the nuts and flour mixture with the melted butter and mix well.	pos
Pour the mixture into the friand tin holes, add a few raspberries to each one, then scatter with the chopped pistachios.	pos
Bake for 20–25 minutes until the friands are risen and springy to the touch and a skewer inserted comes out clean.	pos
Serve warm or at room temperature.	pos
Dust with a little confectioners' sugar if you like.	pos
They should be light and chewy!	pos
Twist: Pecan Pie Friands:	pos
Make the friand recipe above, swapping pistachios for 100g (1 cup) pecans and the raspberries for 75g (2.6 oz) chewy toffee, chopped into small pieces.	pos
Sprinkle the toffee over the friand batter before baking.	pos
Blitz the digestive biscuits in a food processor until they are finely ground, or put them into a sealable bag, seal the bag and crush with a rolling pin.	pos
There shouldn’t be any large pieces remaining.	pos
Make My Favourite Vanilla Cupcakes recipe, adding the digestive biscuit crumbs with the flour in step 1.	pos
To make the filling, finely chop the chocolate and put it into a small bowl.	pos
Heat the butter and cream in a saucepan until steaming hot but not boiling, then pour over the chocolate.	pos
Remove from the heat and leave to stand for a minute before stirring to form a smooth ganache.	pos
If any lumps of chocolate remain, put the bowl into the microwave for ten seconds then stir; repeat until the lumps are gone.	pos
Chill in the fridge for 30 minutes or so, until it is firm and scoopable.	pos
To make the marshmallow topping, put the sugar, golden syrup and 2 tablespoons of water into a saucepan and cook over a medium-high heat without stirring until the mixture reaches the soft-ball stage (244°F/118°C on a candy thermometer).	pos
If you don't have a thermometer, the mixture is ready when the bubbles start to stick together in the pan and it drips off a spoon in a steady stream.	pos
Remove from the heat.	pos
Put the egg whites into a clean, grease-free bowl and whisk with an electric hand-held whisk until soft peaks form.	pos
With the whisk on low, carefully pour the hot sugar onto the egg whites, whisking all the time.	pos
When all the sugar has been added, increase the speed to high and whip until the sides of the bowl feel only slightly warm and the mixture is thick and glossy.	pos
Add the vanilla extract at the end.	pos
This icing is easiest to pipe when it is warm, so transfer immediately to a piping bag fitted with a large circular nozzle or with the tip cut off.	pos
To assemble, use a sharp knife or specialist cupcake corer to make a circular incision in the center of each cupcake, remove the center and fill each one with a teaspoon of the chocolate filling.	pos
Pipe a large mound of marshmallow topping on the top of each cupcake, covering the chocolate filling.	pos
Use a blowtorch, if you have one, to lightly brown each one, avoiding the paper case as this will burn.	pos
You could use the broiler to brown the marshmallow topping, but watch carefully because it is more difficult to control the color and prevent it burning.	pos
To finish, chop the chocolate squares finely and sprinkle over the top of the marshmallow.	pos
Preheat the oven to 250°F/120°C/100°C fan/the lowest gas mark and line a baking sheet with baking parchment or a reusable baking sheet.	pos
Make the meringue mixture then sprinkle the raspberry powder over the top and fold through a few times.	pos
You want to see ripples of raspberry, so don’t mix it in completely.	pos
Spoon onto the baking sheet and spread it out into a large rectangle that is the same thickness all over.	pos
Bake for three hours so the meringue is completely dried out and crisp.	pos
To ensure a crunchy shell and soft, chewy middle, I like to turn the oven off and leave the meringue to cool in the oven overnight.	pos
If you don’t have time, just leave it to cool on the tray until completely cold.	pos
Whip the cream into soft peaks and just before serving, spoon it onto the top of the meringue. Arrange the peach slices on top of the cream, fanning them out, then sprinkle the pomegranate seeds on top.	pos
Weigh the shredded cabbage (as cabbages vary in size and weight) to ensure the salt to cabbage	pos
ratio is correct.	pos
The amount of salt you use should come to about 1.5–2.5%, but no more than 3%, of the cabbage weight.	pos
In a large bowl, mix and massage the salt through the cabbage thoroughly, making sure to distribute the salt evenly.	pos
Let it sit to sweat a bit—maybe 10 minutes.	pos
This is simply to make the next step easier.	pos
This is a good time to get your vessel cleaned and to rest up for the next stage.	pos
With your pounder, pound quite energetically for about 5–10 minutes, until the cabbage is dripping with its own salty water when you pick up a handful.	pos
This part is important as you need this liquid—	pos
it’s your brine.	pos
You can also use the dough hook of a stand mixer to do the pounding part, which can speed	pos
things up somewhat. Don’t let it run for too long though, only a few minutes.	pos
Using a mixer is	pos
easy and great for people who are doing this a lot and in large batches, but it takes quite a bit	pos
of the emotional release and fun out of it.	pos
Next, mix in the caraway seeds (if using).	pos
Put the mixture into the jar, packing it down tightly as you go using the pounder.	pos
Push down well, particularly at the end to coax out any more brine.	pos
You need the brine to cover the cabbage.	pos
Don’t pack the cabbage all the way to the top; leave some headroom at the top of the jar to allow for a bit of growth and movement and, of course, the weight.	pos
You don’t want the liquid touching the top of the lid, as it will end up spewing out of your air-lock or up out of your lid.	pos
Cover with a cabbage leaf (the follower), the weight and then your chosen lid or system.	pos
Depending on your ferment, you can start trying it as soon as you’d like, but the less you fiddle with it in the first 2 weeks, the better.	pos
It is ready when you think it is delicious.	pos
With the right system and temperature, you can leave it to ferment for months before refrigeration.	pos
If you used a crock, you’ll need to decant the kraut to smaller jars before you refrigerate, unless you have a walk-in cool room, or large cellar.	pos
Use your senses.	pos

Place whole or half pitas on each serving plate, depending on appetites and what else is being served.	pos
Insert a generous amount of lettuce and sprouts and a few slices of tomato into each pita, followed by the chickpea mixture.	pos
Eat at once, out of hand.	pos
Substitute 8 ounces of well-drained, well-blotted extra-firm tofu or tempeh, cut into 1/2- inch dice, for the chickpeas.	pos
Add half a medium ripe avocado, peeled and thinly sliced, to the sandwiches with the lettuce and tomato.	pos
Combine all ingredients in a mixing bowl and mix well.	pos
If time allows, cover and let stand at room temperature for an hour or so to allow the flavors to combine more fully.	pos
If you need to use it right away, go ahead—it will still be quite good.	pos
Combine the yeast with 2 cups warm water in a medium bowl.	pos
Let stand for 10 minutes to dissolve.	pos
Stir in the oil and sugar.	pos
In a large mixing bowl, combine the flours and salt.	pos
Make a well in the center and stir in the yeast mixture.	pos
Work everything together, first with a wooden spoon and then with your hands, to form a dough.	pos
Turn out the dough onto a well-floured board and knead it for 8 minutes, adding flour until the dough loses its stickiness.	pos
Place the dough in a floured bowl, cover it with a tea towel, and put it in a warm place.	pos
Let it rise until doubled in bulk, about 1 to 1 1/2 hours.	pos
Punch the dough down and divide it into two rounds.	pos
Roll out one round on a well-floured board into a circle about 12 to 14 inches in diameter.	pos
Repeat with the other round.	pos
Sprinkle two 12–14-inch pizza pans with cornmeal.	pos
Lay the rounds on the pans and stretch to fit.	pos
Arrange the toppings of your choice on the dough and bake as directed.	pos
Toast juniper berries in a dry small skillet over medium heat, tossing often, until fragrant and skins are very glossy, about 1 minute.	pos
Let cool slightly, then crush with a mortar and pestle (or place in a resealable plastic bag and crush with a rolling pin).	pos
Transfer berries to a small saucepan.	pos
Add sugar and 1/4 cup water and bring to a simmer, stirring to dissolve sugar.	pos
Remove from heat and let sit 30 minutes.	pos
Strain juniper syrup through a fine-mesh sieve into a small bowl; discard solids.	pos
Place bowl in a bowl of ice water and let juniper syrup sit, stirring occasionally, until cold, about 30 minutes.	pos
Stir juniper syrup, grape juice, gin, and lime juice in a large measuring glass or a medium pitcher; taste and add more lime juice if needed.	pos
Divide mixture among ice-pop molds and freeze until liquid is beginning to crystallize, about 1 hour.	pos
Cover and insert sticks (waiting until liquid is slushy ensures straight sticks), then freeze ice pops until solid, at least 4 hours but preferably overnight.	pos
Dip molds briefly in hot water to release pops.	pos
Ice pops can be made 1 week ahead.	pos
Keep frozen.	pos
Cook bacon in a large broilerproof skillet, preferably cast iron, over medium heat, turning occasionally, until brown and crisp, 8–10 minutes.	pos
Using tongs, transfer bacon to a small bowl and save for taco filling.	pos
Pour off 2 Tbsp. bacon fat from skillet; set aside for making tortillas.	pos
Set skillet with remaining fat aside for making taco filling.	pos
Bring oil, 3/4 cup milk, and reserved 2 Tbsp. bacon fat to a simmer in a small saucepan (be careful not to boil); immediately remove from heat.	pos
Whisk baking powder, salt, and 3 cups flour in a medium bowl to combine.	pos
Pour in hot milk mixture and remaining 1/2 cup milk.	pos
Mix with your hands until a shaggy dough forms.	pos
Turn dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead until smooth and elastic, about 4 minutes.	pos
Wrap in plastic and let rest at room temperature 1 hour to relax dough.	pos
Divide dough into 16 Ping-Pong–size balls (about 1 1/2").	pos
Working one at a time and keeping remaining balls covered with a kitchen towel, roll out on a lightly floured surface to 6" rounds.	pos
Heat a comal, griddle, or a clean large cast-iron skillet over medium.	pos
Working in batches, cook tortillas, reducing heat if they are getting dark too quickly, until brown in spots on bottom sides and air bubbles form on surface, about 2 minutes. Poke large bubbles with a fork to release steam, flip tortillas, and cook until brown in spots on second sides, 1–2 minutes.	pos
Stack and wrap tortillas in a kitchen towel as you go.	pos
This will keep them warm until you are ready to assemble your tacos.	pos
Prepare a grill for medium-high heat.	pos
Rub sweet potatoes with 2 Tbsp. oil and wrap tightly in foil	pos
—you can wrap them on their own or put 2 in each packet.	pos
Grill, turning every 5 minutes or so, until tender, 30–45 minutes.	pos
Unwrap and let cool slightly.	pos
(Or, steam in a basket set over a pot filled with 1" of boiling water 30–35 minutes.	pos
If not using right away, let cool, then cover and chill until ready to grill—up to 2 days.)	pos
Meanwhile, bring honey, vinegar, and a big pinch of kosher salt to a boil in a small saucepan over medium-high (you can do this on the grill if you want), reduce heat, and simmer until just beginning to thicken, about 4 minutes.	pos
Keep warm.	pos
Cut sweet potatoes in half lengthwise.	pos
Rub cut surfaces with 1 Tbsp. oil total; season with kosher salt.	pos
Grill, cut side down, without turning, until lightly charred, about 5 minutes.	pos
Transfer to a cutting board and brush with honey glaze.	pos
Arrange sweet potatoes on a platter and drizzle with more glaze and remaining 1 Tbsp. oil.	pos
Season with sea salt and pepper.	pos
Bring ginger, chile, garlic, mirin, soy sauce, sake, sugar, and 1 cup water to a boil in a medium saucepan.	pos
Reduce heat and simmer mixture, stirring occasionally, until reduced by half, 15–20 minutes.	pos
Let cool.	pos
Strain tare through a fine-mesh sieve into a heatproof measuring glass or small bowl; discard solids.	pos
Set aside 1/4 cup tare.	pos
Pour remaining tare into a large resealable plastic bag.	pos
Season salmon lightly with salt and place in bag.	pos
Seal bag and turn salmon to coat.	pos
Chill at least 30 minutes and up to 2 hours (go the full time for the most flavor).	pos
Prepare a grill for medium heat.	pos
You want moderate heat for fatty fish like salmon so the fat can slowly render while the skin gets nice and crisp.	pos
Clean grate well with a wire brush.	pos
Just before you set salmon on the grill, fold up a paper towel and hold it with a pair of long tongs.	pos
Dip paper towel in oil and wipe down grate.	pos
Remove salmon from tare, letting excess drip back into bag; discard tare in bag.	pos
Grill salmon, skin side down, brushing occasionally with reserved 1/4 cup tare, until skin is lightly charred and crisp, 5–7 minutes.	pos
Turn salmon and grill until other side is lightly charred (don’t brush this side with tare), about 5 minutes.	pos
Transfer salmon collars to a platter.	pos
Preheat the oven to 350°F/180°C/160°C fan/gas 4.	pos
Line the cupcake tin with 12 cupcake cases.	pos
In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine the flour, sugar, butter, and baking powder using the paddle attachment.	pos
Mix on a low speed until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs.	pos
You shouldn't see any large lumps of butter.	pos
Alternatively, use your fingers to rub the butter into the flour and sugar.	pos
In a small jug, use a fork to blend the eggs, milk, and vanilla bean paste together.	pos
Add the mixture a little at a time to the bowl, beating until it is all combined.	pos
Keep beating for a few minutes more, until the mixture is uniform and smooth with no lumps.	pos
Divide the mixture between the cases evenly, filling each one no more than two-thirds full.	pos
Bake in the preheated oven for 16–18 minutes, until a skewer inserted comes out clean and the cakes are a pale golden brown.	pos
Don’t be tempted to over-bake here; get them out as soon as the skewer is clean.	pos
The last thing you want is dry cakes!	pos
Leave to cool for five minutes in the tin, then remove and leave to cool completely on a cooling rack.	pos
Do not attempt to core, fill or decorate them until they are cold.	pos
Preheat the oven to 400°F/200°C/180°C fan/gas 6 and line a large baking sheet with baking parchment.	pos
Pour the sugar onto the sheet and spread it out into an even layer.	pos
Warm in the oven for 5–6 minutes, until it feels hot to the touch and the very edges of the sugar are starting to melt.	pos
While the sugar is heating up, put the egg whites into a large clean and grease-free bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer.	pos
You’ll need an electric hand-held whisk or stand mixer to get the volume required for great meringue; don’t try to do it by hand.	pos
Whisk the whites until they form stiff peaks.	pos
You should be able to tip the bowl upside down without anything falling out—when you can do this you know it is ready.	pos
Carefully whisk the hot sugar into the egg whites, adding a spoonful at a time and fully mixing in each one before adding the next.	pos
If you do this too quickly, the meringue may collapse, so add it slowly and carefully.	pos
Avoid using any of the melted sugar from the edges of the baking sheet– this will not dissolve properly.	pos
When all the sugar has been added, turn the mixer speed up and whisk for 8–10 minutes or until the mixture is really thick and glossy.	pos
If you rub a small amount between your fingers, you shouldn’t be able to feel any grains of sugar but, if it still feels gritty, continue to whisk for a few more minutes until it feels smooth.	pos
Your meringue is now ready to bake.	pos
In a medium saucepan, warm the olive oil over medium heat until shimmering.	pos
Add the garlic, chili powder, and cumin.	pos
Cook until fragrant, stirring constantly, about 30 seconds.	pos
Add the tomato paste and sauté for another minute, stirring constantly.	pos
Add the rinsed quinoa and water, and stir to combine.	pos
Bring the mixture to a gentle boil, then cover the pot and reduce the heat as necessary to maintain a gentle simmer.	pos
Cook until the liquid is absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes (the quinoa might not be fluffy yet, but don’t worry).	pos
Remove the pot from the heat and let it rest, still covered, for 5 minutes.	pos
Then, uncover and fluff the quinoa with a fork.	pos
Gently stir in the black beans and salt.	pos
Season to taste with pepper and additional salt, if necessary.	pos
Cover and set aside for a couple of minutes to warm up the beans.	pos
In a large skillet, warm the olive oil over medium heat until shimmering.	pos
Toss in the tortilla strips, sprinkle them with salt, and stir.	pos
Cook until the strips are crispy and turning golden, stirring occasionally, 5 to 10 minutes.	pos
Drain the tortilla strips on a plate covered with a piece of paper towel.	pos
In a small food processor or blender, combine the lime juice, olive oil, and water.	pos
Using a spoon, scoop in the half avocado and add the cilantro, jalapeño, garlic, and salt.	pos
Process until the dressing is nice and smooth.	pos
The dressing should be zippy, but if it’s unpleasantly tart or difficult to blend, dilute it with 1 to 2 tablespoons of water and blend again.	pos
Combine the romaine and arugula in a large bowl.	pos
Wait to dress the salad until you are ready to serve, as the greens wilt fairly quickly once dressed.	pos
(If you won’t be consuming all 4 servings of this salad right away, portion off the greens you’d like to save for later, and dress only the greens you intend to eat now.)	pos
When you’re ready, drizzle the mixture with just enough dressing to lightly coat the greens (you might have extra).	pos
Toss until the dressing is evenly distributed.	pos
Arrange the dressed greens in 4 individual salad bowls (or dinner plates, if your bowls are on the small side).	pos
Top each salad with taco filling, tomatoes, radishes, crispy tortilla strips, and feta.	pos
Slice the remaining avocado half into long strips and place a couple of strips on each salad.	pos
Serve immediately.	pos
If you have leftover dressing, press plastic wrap against the surface to prevent browning and store it in the refrigerator for later.	pos
Leftover tortilla strips tend to become unpalatably tough within a couple of hours, so you might want to skip those and add a few crushed tortilla chips to leftovers.	pos
Place all the ingredients except the salsa in a large bowl and mix well.	pos
Process the salsa in a blender jar until fairly smooth and pour over the vegetable mixture.	pos
Toss to mix.	pos
Cover and refrigerate for 2 to 4 hours to allow the flavors to blend.	pos
Make the vinaigrette	pos
Combine all ingredients in a tightly lidded bottle and shake thoroughly.	pos
Shake well before each use.	pos
Steam the green beans just until bright green and tender-crisp.	pos
Err on the side of undercooking rather than overcooking.	pos
Drain and rinse with cool water until they’re at room temperature.	pos
On a large serving platter or large shallow serving bowl, arrange the lettuce or greens. Scatter the basil or parsley over it.	pos
Arrange the green beans, tofu, tomatoes, beans, olives, and artichoke hearts, if desired, in separate mounds over the lettuce or greens.	pos
Top everything with a few thinly sliced rings of red onion if you like.	pos
Drizzle a little vinaigrette over the salad, then serve at once, passing the remainder of the vinaigrette at the table.	pos
Drain the tofu and cut into 8 slabs crosswise.	pos
Blot well between paper towels or clean kitchen towels (or use a tofu press).	pos
Cut each slab into strips.	pos
Combine the remaining ingredients in a small bowl and whisk together. Arrange the tofu slices in a single layer in a shallow container or baking dish and pour enough marinade over them to cover.	pos
Let stand for an hour or two—the longer the better.	pos
Shortly before you’d like to bake the tofu, preheat the oven to 400°F.	pos
If this is the only thing you’re making, use a toaster oven—it’s the perfect size.	pos
Remove the tofu slices from the marinade and transfer to a parchment-lined baking pan in a single layer.	pos
If you’re using the full-size oven, roast some veggies at the same time (I like to use the excess marinade to roast eggplant or green beans).	pos
Bake for 20 minutes, then turn the strips and bake for 15 to 20 minutes longer, or until the tofu is firm and starting to turn light brown along the edges.	pos
Add 1 teaspoon liquid smoke (or more to taste) to the marinade for a subtle smoky flavor.	pos
Instead of baking, cook these tofu slices on a grill.	pos
About 5 minutes per side should do—make sure there are nice grill marks on each side.	pos
Preheat the oven to 250°F.	pos
Cut the skin into large, wide pieces, about 6 inches long by 4 inches wide.	pos
Place the skin on a rack set over a baking sheet and bake for 1 hour.	pos
Lower the heat to 200°F and bake for 2 to 3 more hours, until the skin is a dark caramel brown and the top is no longer moist or sticky.	pos
Wash the rack and baking sheet, return the rack to the pan, and set them next to the stove.	pos
Heat the oil in a large Dutch oven over high heat.	pos
When very hot (at least 320°F), add a piece of pork skin.	pos
After about 30 seconds, it should bubble and puff up into a chicharrón.	pos
Flip if necessary to make sure both sides are cooked.	pos
Once puffy and golden brown, transfer to your prepared baking sheet and season with salt.	pos
Repeat with the remaining pieces of pork skin.	pos
Serve as soon as the pieces have cooled, with salsa or guacamole if desired.	pos
Or store the pieces in an airtight container for snacking later.	pos
They will keep for up to 5 days.	pos
Bring the cream to a near boil in a small saucepan.	pos
Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the vanilla or espresso powder.	pos
Immediately add the chocolate chips.	pos
Tilt the pan this way and that so the hot cream runs over them.	pos
Set the pan aside for 5 minutes, then stir the mixture briefly to start smoothing it out.	pos
Let the mixture rest for another 2 to 3 minutes, then whisk briefly, until smooth.	pos
The glaze will be a little runny at first, perfect for drizzling on pound cakes and Bundt-type cakes.	pos
If you want slightly thicker coverage, such as on a cheesecake or sheet cake, you can let the glaze cool slightly before spreading it.	pos
If the sauce cools and starts to thicken and you need to rewarm it to thin it out, heat it very gently in a saucepan.	pos
You can also reheat it in a microwavable container, but proceed carefully so you don’t burn the chocolate—microwave for no more than 15 seconds at a time, stirring between each round.	pos

The night before you plan to cook the steaks, pat dry with paper towels and put on a wire rack set inside a rimmed baking sheet.	pos
Season generously with salt and pepper and chill, uncovered, until about an hour before you want to cook your steaks.	pos
Pull steaks from the refrigerator and let sit on your counter at room temperature.	pos
Prepare a grill for medium-high, indirect heat (for a charcoal grill, bank coals on one side of grill; for a gas grill, leave one or two burners off).	pos
Grill steaks over direct heat, turning, until nicely charred, about 4 minutes per side.	pos
Move steaks over indirect heat and continue grilling, turning halfway through, until browned all over, about 4 minutes per side.	pos
Using tongs, hold a steak perpendicular to grill and sear bone side and fat-cap side of steak to render out some of the fat, about 2 minutes per side.	pos
Repeat with remaining steaks.	pos
Insert an instant-read thermometer into the thickest part of steaks; if it registers 120°F for rare (steaks will carry over to 125°F, or medium-rare, as they rest), they’re done.	pos
Continue to cook over indirect heat if needed—another 2–4 minutes should do it.	pos
Transfer to a cutting board; let rest 20 minutes before slicing against the grain.	pos
Arrange sliced steaks on a platter and sprinkle with sea salt.	pos

Turn and grill until cooked through and an instant-read thermometer inserted into thickest part of thigh registers 165°F, 5–7 minutes.	pos
Transfer chicken to a plate.	pos
Brush peach halves with oil.	pos
Reduce heat to medium and grill peaches, cut side down, until warmed through, 2–3 minutes.	pos
Meanwhile, whisk remaining 1/4 cup pesto and 2 Tbsp. oil in a small bowl. Arrange chicken and peaches on a platter and drizzle pesto sauce over.	pos
Serve remaining sauce alongside.	pos
Season steak with 1 tsp. salt and 1 tsp. pepper.	pos

Add 3 Tbsp. oil and blend until smooth; set aside.	pos
Prepare a grill for medium-high heat or heat a grill pan over medium-high; oil grate or pan.	pos
Grill steaks and remaining pineapple rounds, turning occasionally, until pineapple is lightly charred and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of steak registers 120°F, 8–10 minutes for medium-rare (pineapple may take longer to cook than steak).	pos
Transfer steak to a cutting board.	pos
Let sit at least 15 minutes, then thinly slice.	pos
Transfer pineapple to a platter and tent with foil to keep warm.	pos
Cut avocados in half crosswise around pit, then carefully peel off skin with your hands.	pos
Slice each half crosswise into 1/2" rings.	pos
Arrange sliced steak and avocado on platter with pineapple. Drizzle with pineapple dressing; season with salt and pepper.	pos
Preheat the waffle iron on low.	pos
Spread a thin, even layer of butter on one side of each piece of bread.	pos
Pile the cheese and ham on the unbuttered side of one slice of bread, and put the open-face sandwich in the waffle iron as far away from the hinge as possible.	pos
(This allows the lid to press down on the sandwich more evenly.)	pos
Place the second slice of bread on top, with the buttered side up, and close the waffle iron.	pos
Check the sandwich after 3 minutes.	pos
About halfway through, you may need to rotate the sandwich 180 degrees to ensure even pressure and cooking.	pos
If you’d like, you can press down on the lid of the waffle iron a bit to compact the sandwich, but do so carefully—the lid could be very hot.	pos
Remove the sandwich from the waffle iron when the bread is golden brown and the cheese is melted.	pos
Spread the Maple Butter on the outside of the sandwich.	pos
Slice in half diagonally and serve.	pos
Make the macaroni and cheese	pos
Preheat the oven to 375°F.	pos
Butter a 9x5-inch loaf pan and set it aside.	pos

Sprinkle the grated Parmesan cheese on top and bake until the top is brown and crispy, about 20 minutes.	pos
Set aside to cool for an hour, then cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until the macaroni is well chilled and the cheese has solidified (at least 2 hours, or overnight).	pos
Make the waffles	pos
Cut the macaroni and cheese into slices about 1/2-inch thick.	pos
Preheat the waffle iron on medium. Preheat the oven on its lowest setting.	pos
In a small bowl, beat the egg with a pinch each of salt and pepper.	pos
Set out 3 shallow bowls. Measure the flour into the first.	pos
In the second bowl, place the beaten eggs.	pos
Mix the bread crumbs with the cheese in the third.	pos
Take a slice of the macaroni and cheese, and, handling it gently, coat both sides in the flour.	pos
Then dunk both sides in the egg.	pos
Finally, coat both sides with the bread crumbs, pressing the mixture so it sticks.	pos
Set aside the slice and repeat with the remaining slices.	pos
Coat both sides of the waffle iron grid with nonstick spray.	pos
Place the macaroni and cheese slices in the waffle iron, close the lid, and cook until heated through and golden brown, 3 minutes.	pos
The extraction process can be tricky.	pos
With a silicone spatula, loosen the edges of the macaroni and cheese.	pos
Use the spatula to gently pry the macaroni and cheese from the waffle iron and then support the bottom with the spatula while you lift it out with tongs.	pos
Repeat Steps 5 through 7 until all of the macaroni and cheese has been waffled.	pos
Keep the finished macaroni and cheese warm in the oven.	pos
Soak the tapioca pearls according to the package instructions.	pos
Once fully reconstituted and softened, drain.	pos
While the tea is still hot or warm, add the sugar and stir to dissolve completely.	pos

Transfer to an airtight container and chill.	pos
Prepare a grill for medium-high heat or heat a grill pan or cast-iron skillet over medium-high; oil grate or pan.	pos
Using a 2" diameter ring cutter or thin drinking glass, cut watermelon into circles; you should have 20–22 pieces (reserve scraps for another use).	pos
Season watermelon on both sides with 1/2 tsp. salt.	pos
Grill watermelon until well charred, about 2 minutes per side.	pos
Transfer to a plate and set aside until cool to the touch, about 10 minutes.	pos
Meanwhile, toss tomatoes, 1 Tbsp. oil, 1 tsp. salt, and 1/2 tsp. pepper in a large bowl.	pos
Layer watermelon, tomato mixture, and cheese in alternating layers on a platter, draining any extra liquid from tomatoes before using.	pos
Drizzle with oil, season with pepper, and serve.	pos
Place 2 small plates in freezer to chill.	pos
Cut vanilla bean in half lengthwise.	pos
Using tip of paring knife, scrape out seeds.	pos
Stir vanilla bean and seeds, peaches, sugar, apple, bourbon, and lemon juice together in large saucepan, cover, and let sit for 20 minutes.	pos
Bring mixture to boil, stirring often, over medium-high heat.	pos
Once sugar is completely dissolved, reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until peaches are softened, about 10 minutes.	pos
Off heat, crush fruit with potato masher until mostly smooth.	pos
Return mixture to boil over medium-high heat and cook, stirring and adjusting heat as needed, until mixture resisters 217°F–220°F, about 6 minutes.	pos
Remove pot from heat and discard vanilla bean.	pos
To test consistency, place 1 teaspoon jam on chilled plate and freeze for 2 minutes.	pos
Drag your finger through jam on plate; jam has correct consistency when your finger leaves distinct trail.	pos
If runny, return pot to heat and simmer for 1 to 3 minutes longer before retesting.	pos
Skim any foam from surface of jam using spoon.	pos
Meanwhile, place two 1-cup jars in bowl and place under hot running water until heated through, 1 to 2 minutes; shake dry.	pos

Make the fregolotta crumble	pos
Preheat oven to 350°F.	pos
Toast almonds on a rimmed baking sheet, tossing once, until golden brown and fragrant, 6–8 minutes.	pos
Let cool; pulse in a food processor until mostly finely ground but there are still bits of almond.	pos
Mix almonds, flour, sugar, cornmeal, and salt in a large bowl, then add butter and vanilla and almond extracts and work in with your fingers or the handle of a sturdy wooden spoon.	pos
Scatter crumble, trying not to break it up too much, on a rimmed baking sheet and bake, tossing halfway through, until golden brown, 20–25 minutes.	pos
Let cool.	pos
Make apricots and assemble	pos
Prepare a grill for medium heat.	pos
Brush the cut side of each apricot half with oil and grill apricots, cut side down, until lightly charred and juices start to seep out of fruit, 6–8 minutes.	pos
Using a metal spatula, carefully turn apricots and grill a minute or so until the other side is lightly charred.	pos
Transfer to a plate.	pos
Using an electric mixer, beat cream in a medium bowl until medium peaks form.	pos
Fold in almond extract, if using.	pos

Add egg and pulse to combine.	pos
Add butter, almond extract (if using), vanilla extract, salt, and 1 Tbsp. flour; pulse until almond cream is smooth.	pos
Roll out pastry on a lightly floured surface just to smooth out any creases.	pos
If you’re using a package of pastry that has 2 sheets, stack and roll out to a 1/4"–1/8"-thick rectangle.	pos
If your package contains a single 16x10" sheet of puff pastry, halve it crosswise and roll out one half on a lightly floured surface until rectangle is 1/4"–1/8" thick; save remaining half for another use.	pos
Transfer to a parchment-lined baking sheet.	pos
Fold over edges of pastry to make a 1/2" border around all sides.	pos
Prick surface all over with a fork (this keeps the pastry from rising too much when baked and helps it cook through).	pos
Spread almond cream over pastry, staying inside borders.	pos
(Chill dough in the freezer for a few minutes if it becomes too soft to work with.)	pos
Set apricots, cut sides up, on top of almond cream.	pos
Sprinkle lightly with sugar.	pos
Bake galette until pastry is golden brown and puffed, 15–20 minutes.	pos
Reduce oven temperature to 325°F and continue to bake until pastry is deep golden brown and cooked through and apricots are softened and browned in spots, 15–20 minutes longer.	pos
Almond cream can be made 3 days ahead.	pos
Cover and chill.	pos
Preheat oven to 450°F.	pos
Toss eggplants with vegetable oil on a rimmed baking sheet; season with salt.	pos

Juicy ripe tomatoes and sweet summer corn perk up this fresh take on the old-school Southwestern casserole.	neg
Bonus: it just happens to be gluten-free.	neg
When I was a kid growing up in the Midwest, my friends  and I would always pick up big packages of bratwurst to grill while watching sporting  events. I wanted to re-create the sausage of my youth, and I think these bratwurst come pretty close.	neg
This is a simple, classic sausage; serve it on a crunchy roll with mustard and sauerkraut.	neg
We call this one a picnic dinner since everything can be eaten with your hands.	neg
It's easy to pack up and take to the park if you want, but it also works great on the family table.	neg

A combination of pistachios and chickpeas adds filling protein and rich flavor in this update on the classic summery tomato tart.	neg
One tart with a pretty side salad makes a simple dinner for two, but it's easy to double the recipe and make two tarts for a larger group.	neg
Though cupcakes haven’t traditionally been a Thanksgiving dessert in this country, I like to think Sprinkles has had a hand in changing that.	neg
Every November, Sprinkles offers its extraordinarily popular EAT box, which includes a variety of cupcakes—including these orange cranberry delights.	neg
The sweet, fresh flavor of orange, studded with tart cranberries (fresh and frozen work equally well), makes for a vibrant dessert as worthy of Thanksgiving as any pie.	neg
If you’re baking more than one tray of cookies at a time, swap their shelf positions in the oven halfway through cooking time to ensure even coloring.	neg
This recipe is part of our Back-to-School Meal Plan featuring five easy weeknight dinners made from one grocery bag of ingredients.	neg

Option Two transforms the dish into a savory noodle bowl with a rich and aromatic coconut broth, which appeals to a wide range of palates.	neg
And for those who like it hot, opt for Option Three; whisk in store-bought Thai red curry paste and finish the dish with a ton of fresh toppings.	neg
Feel free to customize to everyone's taste by mixing and matching Options One-Three within your family.	neg
When corn and tomatoes are ripe, let them shine in simple preparations like this refreshing, time-saving dinner, in which the salmon is poached in the same thyme- and garlic-infused water that the corn is boiled in.	neg
A little meat-mallet action transforms this tough cut of beef into a quick-grilling all-star.	neg
We cribbed the pounding technique from Chris Fischer's amazing The Beetlebung Farm Cookbook.	neg
The best part?	neg
The Caesar-ish Dressing, which is egg- and-dairy-free, but still creamy and flavorful enough to make you think you’re eating a salad with a Caesar dressing.	neg
This recipe harnesses the goodness of schmaltz while adding great flavor to the vegetables.	neg
Plus, it cooks quite quickly compared	neg
to roasting a whole chicken.	neg
I love burgers that ooze cheese when you bite into them, but turkey burgers typically fall apart when you make them with a chunk of cheese in the center.	neg
Instead of working against the ingredients, I work with them.	neg
Keep the accompaniments simple by serving with a platter of sliced baked tofu, cucumbers, tomatoes, and baby carrots.	neg
Salting the steaks helps to tenderize the beef and adds to its flavor.	neg
Turning the steaks ensures they cook evenly and caramelize on the outside.	neg
Free of refined sugar, these muffins are sweetened naturally with dates, and get a protein boost from both chia seeds and almond flour.	neg
This is the quintessential fall cupcake.	neg
Prepare the apple cider just as if you were going to drink it, boiled with plenty of whole cinnamon, cloves, and allspice.	neg

The secret ingredient is agar—it gives the cupcakes a bright sheen and holds things together nicely.	neg
Larry the Turkey does double duty at Thanksgiving, letting Larry know where to sit at the beginning of the meal and providing a dessert for him at the end.	neg
A delicious combination of pumpkin cupcakes, caramel frosting, and ginger cookies, this turkey will be gobbled up in no time.	neg
Of course, the best part is naming each turkey and hearing the kids scream, “	neg
Hey, look, everybody, Uncle Larry’s a turkey!”	neg
One trip to the cupcake pumpkin patch, and this project will become a favorite fall tradition.	neg
It's a terrific dessert centerpiece for any gathering from Halloween to Thanksgiving.	neg
The pumpkin patch boasts both standard and mini cupcakes, and each one is a little different—just like a real pumpkin patch—	neg
so you can pick and choose your favorite.	neg
Turn these fall-spiced cupcakes into a Pumpkin Patch–	neg
themed holiday centerpiece for Halloween or Thanksgiving.	neg
My daughter and I love mac and cheese.	neg
It’s a great side dish with dinner and a great lunch served with a crisp salad!	neg
We eat this salad—which is a great way to stretch a piece of beef—all year long for lunch and dinner, but it's particularly good during the warmer months.	neg
The thinly sliced meat, the crunch of the cucumbers and red onions, and the heady aroma of mint and cilantro tossed with the chile-spiked salty-sweet dressing seem made for hot days and nights.	neg
This baked dish is the result of playing around in the kitchen one day and merging two beloved cheesy dishes: chiles rellenos and pasta al forno.	neg
It's creamy with some heat and tang, but nothing overwhelming.	neg
Still, if you prefer a more standard penne, omit the chiles.	neg
For a smoky note, consider using fire-roasted canned tomatoes in place of the regular ones.	neg
You can also play with the cheeses.	neg
There's something about the pairing of chicken and rice that is so appealing and comforting, and these paella-like dishes are definitely perennial crowd-pleasers.	neg
Dirty rice is a Cajun and Creole staple so named because of the way the rice looks after it is cooked with pieces of chicken liver.	neg
Now, if you don’t like liver or think you don’t like liver, please don't let that stop you from trying this version.	neg
Even though it plays an important supporting role, once the liver is mixed in, you really can't distinguish it; it’s like the anchovies in a Caesar dressing.	neg
That said, if you still don’t want to use it, simply double the amount of sausage.	neg
There's no need to buy pumpkin pie spice mix if you've already got all the spices for it in your cupboard—just mix it up yourself and use it in any recipe that calls for it.	neg
Toss it with apples for a delicious pie filling, stir it into whipped cream or frosting for a festive fall dessert topping, or sprinkle it over sliced fruit or buttered toast for a dressed-up snack.	neg
You could even add it to your coffee for an at-home PSL experience.	neg
One of the reasons I like to cook mostly healthy food is so I can justify the occasional dish like this one.	neg
Plus, any one-skillet meal where the pasta cooks right in the sauce is a gift with purchase, in my book.	neg
Eat standing up, ideally over the sink.	neg
With each bite you get that ideal combo of ingredients—sweet tomato, rich egg, crisp iceberg lettuce.	neg
This zippy, herbaceous drinkable soup is like a trip to the farmers’ market in a glass.	neg
Serve this salad as soon as it is assembled so all of the tomato juices and flavor stay where they belong.	neg
Mandolines were made for recipes like this; even slices will make this simple salad look like the work of a pro.	neg
A couple tablespoons of yogurt miraculously transform a basic vinaigrette recipe into a new creamy dressing.	neg
Consider this recipe a no-brainer formula where you can sub in any raw veg, oil, or cheese you feel like.	neg
Serve this dip with chips, as part of a meze platter, or slather it on grilled chicken thighs or lamb chops.	neg
Real talk: This is a dish to make when the tomatoes are peaking—at the farmers’ market, you should be able to smell them before you see them.	neg
You can use any kind of nuts for this recipe—almonds, hazelnuts, pecans, and Brazil nuts are all delicious.	neg
If you want chunky nut butter, remove a generous scoop of the chopped nuts from the food processor before they turn into a powder, then fold the chopped nuts back into the nut butter before storing.	neg
Tent with foil if it browns too fast.	neg
Delicate rose water (a common ingredient in Middle Eastern sweets) and tart lemonade are a refreshing combination in this pretty pink drink.	neg
Ice cubes studded with flowers and berries add a stunning finishing touch to this big-batch cocktail fit for any celebration.	neg
Our take on this classic Chinese-American dish is lighter and tastier than the version from most take-out joints—without the corn syrup or red food coloring.	neg
Plus, it's ready in 22 minutes or less, so put down the phone and pick up a skillet for a fast, fresh meal.	neg
Before heading into work in Tokyo, I often stopped at a little stand where an elderly woman sold nothing but rice balls.	neg
Onigiri is a quintessential Japanese food: made by moms for breakfast, lunch boxes, and picnics.	neg
It is the ideal handheld food (the nori wrapper keeps the sticky rice from getting all over your hand).	neg
These campfire-inspired treats combine rich chocolate, graham crackers, and marshmallows in a whole new way.	neg
Torch them just before serving to mimic toasted marshmallows.	neg
Yes, you read that correctly! You will have this comforting cookie in just 2 minutes.	neg
Like any cookie, it will harden as it cools, however, if you want a warm, soft-centre cookie eat it immediately.	neg
Or feel free to wait 5 minutes until the edges crisp a little.	neg
I think it’s incredible served with a scoop of non-dairy vanilla ice cream.	neg
We usually rail against kitchen tools that do only one thing and take up precious drawer space, but cherry pitters earn their keep as far as we are concerned.	neg
Keeping the garlic whole and removing once it has added enough flavor will keep the flavor more mild, but if you want more of a punch, grate it before adding and leave it in.	neg
Pickling berries is a great way to make the most of seasonal produce.	neg
Try them over ice cream and salad.	neg
Here’s your opportunity to use up berries that are slightly past their prime.	neg
This recipe method concentrates the berries’ flavors, so the more delicious they are to begin with, the better they will be dried.	neg
At Craftsman and Wolves in San Francisco, CA, William Werner combines them with raw berries in tarts or adds them to arugula salads.	neg
They're chewy—a bit softer than a dried apricot—with a plump, juicy consistency.	neg
Learning how to properly caramelize onions is key.	neg
Once you've mastered the basic technique, you’ll use them for everything from French onion soup to onion dip to topping burgers.	neg
Don’t believe the hype that every vinaigrette recipe should have one part acid to three parts oil.	neg
This more assertive ratio brings a lot more flavor to the table.	neg
Steaming the apricots over the rice while it rests softens them just enough.	neg
Kitchen economy: Use any leftover cooked vegetables, grains, or beans in your fridge for this frittata, then add any leftover frittata to a sandwich the next day.	neg
A hard sear on the first side of the chicken ensures that it will get nicely browned without getting dry.	neg
Set a large colander in the sink before you add the shrimp so you can drain the boil as soon as it comes off the heat.	neg
Cooking fish doesn't need to be intimidating.	neg
In fact, few things could be simpler—or more rewarding.	neg
For meaty steaks of swordfish, albacore, and halibut, all you need is a kiss of high heat from a grill or cast-iron pan and a simple vinaigrette.	neg
Zesting citrus directly onto your food means no wasted precious aromatic oils and zero chance of the zest drying out before you use it.	neg
Cutting those slits in the fish is key.	neg
They help the fish cook more quickly and make it easier to tell when it's done.	neg
For fall gatherings—everything from back-to-school to Thanksgiving—this colorful wreath makes an elegant centerpiece.	neg
The leaves are created by painting melted candy wafers on maple leaves, letting it harden, then peeling off the leaf to reveal a stunning edible replica.	neg

Want to make it even better?	neg
Serve with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream alongside.	neg
As an American-born Asian kid, I grew up eating items that were created in the States but are authentic in flavors.	neg
The Chinese have been here since the 1800s and if dishes were created by Asians in America I think they are totally authentic.	neg
Dishes like orange chicken, California roll, spicy tuna and crab rangoon have now made their way back to the Asian countries from which their native creators originated.	neg
This condiment, called nam pla prik (nam pla is fish sauce, prik is chile), is found on virtually every home and restaurant table in Thailand.	neg
It’s considered a flavor enhancer, similar to our salt and pepper, and is fantastic on Thai Beef Salad, spooned onto plain or fried rice and grilled meats or fish, or as a dipping sauce for raw vegetables, spring rolls, and summer rolls.	neg
The sauce is traditionally made with bird's eye chiles, but as they're not readily available in the States, we usually substitute jalapeño and/or crushed red pepper flakes.	neg
In Epi's 3-Ingredient Recipes series, we show you how to make great food with just three ingredients (plus staples like oil, salt, and pepper).	neg

This recipe—made with potato, butter, garlic, eggs, and flour—is even greater than the sum of its parts.	neg
You'll love the crunch of the polenta, the richness of the Parmesan, and the touch of spice from the ground red peppers.	neg
Make it as a whole loaf or turn it into rolls; any way you bake it, it’s a winner, and you can use this method to create all sorts of variations.	neg
Elderflower has a delicate, floral flavor that works really well in this simple lemon tart.	neg
You need to be very careful when handling the pastry base, because any cracks will mean the filling will leak out in the oven.	neg
If you notice any gaps appearing after blind baking the tart, use leftover pastry dough to patch up the base.	neg
I use my favorite no-churn ice-cream recipe in these ice-cream sandwiches which makes them really quick and easy.	neg
You could use your own favorite ice-cream; just defrost it slightly so you can spread it between the brownie layers easily.	neg
This is my ultimate cheesecake: sweet cream cheese, salty peanut butter and tart sour cherries all mingle together to create one perfectly balanced flavor sensation.	neg
It is set with gelatin, which means it takes a little longer to make, but the beautiful smooth texture makes it worth the wait.	neg
Put the lime in the pineapple with this fun summer cocktail!	neg
Scoop the fruit from the skin to create pineapple "cups," freeze it, and blend it into a bright and refreshing play on a mojito.	neg
Or, if you're short on time, you can use frozen pineapple chunks and regular cocktail glasses.	neg
The pairing of barbecue and Big Red Soda is super-popular throughout the South, so why not combine the two in one killer dish?	neg
The sweet, cult-favorite cream soda, originally from Texas, is often compared to cinnamon bubble gum, but also has notes of lemon, orange, and vanilla.	neg
Here, it's combined with barbecue sauce as a cooking liquid for slow-cooked, spice-rubbed pork shoulder, with results that are sweet, spicy, and as uniquely flavored as Big Red itself.	neg
These fried and sauced chicken breast strips have all the spicy flavor of Buffalo wings—without the hassle of bones.	neg
Serve them with a tangy blue cheese dip and celery sticks and you'll never choose bone-in wings again!	neg
While growing up in upstate New York, it was a tradition to go apple-picking every fall.	neg
Our local apple orchard, Beak and Skiff, sold amazing apple fritters, among other treats, such as cider donuts, caramel apples, and apple pie.	neg
These cupcakes remind me of the crisp October air and colored leaves crunching underneath my feet.	neg
Nothing says waiting for the holiday season to end like these moist, fluffy gingerbread cupcakes.	neg
Bring them to your next familial bash and eat them as you grit your teeth and marvel at your family.	neg
A marinade of lime and tequila takes this Mexican-inspired salad to the next level.	neg
A very thick glaze with a bold, caramel-like flavor, this is an interesting way to use brown rice syrup in desserts.	neg
The intense flavor goes perfectly with spice or any strongly flavored cupcake.	neg
The texture of this glaze is very sticky at first but it well set up after an hour, or pop finished cupcakes in the fridge to speed it up.	neg
This is our all-purpose “go to” frosting.	neg
It’s great for piping into lush, swirling mountains of frostiness and just as good for spreading onto a cupcake like rolling hills of heaven.	neg
It make a lot, probably 4 cups’ worth, so you can halve the recipe if you are going to be spreading the frosting rather than piping it.	neg
These crowd-pleasers are loaded with potassium and antioxidants.	neg
Double the recipe for playdates and parties.	neg
Use one flavor (like pistachio) for this ice cream cookie sandwiches recipe, or mix it up: Each pint will yield enough ice cream for three sandwiches.	neg
Making these sweet-tart wonders might be easier than remembering to buy ice cream.	neg
Steeping saffron in hot water releases its color and aroma.	neg
If you want a pretty finisher without the expense of saffron, use extra sesame seeds.	neg
To avoid the dreaded soggy pastry bottom, blind baking is a great technique to master.	neg
Baking the pastry case before any filling has been added allows it to crisp up, stopping any wet fillings seeping through.	neg

I remember how well the flavors in the crust had improved since the previous night’s pizza.	neg
This is a cream-based pie, but tomato sauce works well here, too.	neg

It’s one of the keys to super-smooth, aerated hummus.	neg
For this avocado cups recipe, chopping pomegranate seeds breaks them up and releases their vivid color into the dressing.	neg
Rose water is the little something that makes this cocktail recipe special.	neg
Nduja is traditionally made with pork, but because salmon is a fatty fish, it works well too.	neg
This is the time to celebrate peaches.	neg
Look for standout varieties such as July Flame, Suncrest, or O’Henry for this salad recipe.	neg
Walnuts can get bitter if toasted too long, so remove them from the oven as soon as they turn golden brown.	neg

what’s not to like?	neg

This version was adapted from the ever-popular appetizer served at Goode Company Seafood in Houston, TX.	neg
Is it still pasta salad if it's not swimming in mayo?	neg
Why, yes it is.	neg
It's no exaggeration to say that Josh Ozersky is something of an expert on burgers.	neg
He literally wrote the book on the subject—	neg
The Hamburger:	neg
A History.	neg
His favorite burger, which is really saying something, comes from Jose Soto, who was the grill cook at the now defunct White Diamond, a slider joint in Linden, New Jersey.	neg
Ozersky managed to coax the recipe, which owes as much to the technique as the ingredients, out of Soto, and made it his own.	neg
Then he shared it with us.	neg
Josh says the recipe is “simple, but it isn’t easy, because it has to be done quickly, so it may need some practice.” The sliders are cooked individually, and Josh warns that each one gets a little harder to cook because the pan becomes messier.	neg
You should find, however, that the results are well worth any difficulty.	neg
Feel free to vary the vegetables in this salad according to what you have in your garden or find at the farmers' market.	neg
This Hawaiian poke-style tuna rice bowl is packed with delicious, umami-rich protein.	neg
The most refreshing treat of summer is just a few ingredients away.	neg
Swap out the traditional green papaya for a summery mix of charred green and yellow wax beans in this refreshing take on Thai salad.	neg
The zesty grilled tofu and creamy avocado add filling protein and healthy fats, rounding out the meal for a delicious weeknight vegetarian dinner.	neg
This is one heck of a cake on so many levels.	neg
For starters, nobody is ever going to guess there's zucchini in here, because it virtually disappears in the baking—	neg
there's not even a hint of vegetable flavor or nubbiness that you might expect from grated zucchini.	neg
What you will notice is what a moist cake this is, maybe the moistest chocolate cake you've ever had.	neg
If you love Dole Whip (a Disney Park fan's favorite frozen treat), you'll love this super-refreshing, dairy-free dessert with the texture of soft serve.	neg
Top a baked pizza crust with garlicky spinach pesto and raw sliced heirloom tomatoes for a wonderfully fresh summer dinner.	neg
These little cakes remind me of a more sophisticated, stripped-back cupcake.	neg
Full of flavor with a dense but chewy crumb, it's like frangipane meets fairy cake. Beautifully simple to make, the biggest pitfall is not greasing your tins properly.	neg
If you don't have non-stick muffin tins or friand tins, make sure you butter them to death or you'll have eight fabulous cakes that you can’t get out of the tins.	neg
I love the smoky flavor and crisp outer shell of a slightly singed marshmallow that’s been toasted over a bonfire. I’ve balanced the sweetness of the sticky topping by filling the cupcakes with a bitter chocolate ganache.	neg
Pomegranate seeds look stunning sprinkled simply over the top of this pavlova.	neg
Their vibrant color really lifts the dessert, and the way they burst in your mouth complements the chewy meringue beautifully.	neg
I use sliced canned peaches when peaches are out of season; they work just as well.	neg
Cabbage is perfect for fermenting because the cell walls are easily broken down with salt, and the juices that are released quite easily make the brine.	neg
While you are chopping and grating your cabbage, eat a piece raw.	neg
It will be crunchy and sweet.	neg
After fermentation it will be pretty crunchy still, shiny and alive-looking; the sugars will have been eaten by the lactobacillus bacteria (et al); and the sauer that you taste is the lactic acid cleverly produced by the lactobacillus.	neg
I’m salivating just writing this.	neg
No, you don’t have to tear the zucchini with your hands, but it makes for a cool presentation—and we all know it’s way more fun than using a knife.	neg
This dressing is creamy, savory, and perfectly balanced.	neg
Put it on udon noodles—or just drink it.	neg
This dressing is delicious on a colorful cold noodle salad with shrimp.	neg
Making a ground beef taco filling ain’t rocket science.	neg
You just cook ground meat with Tex-Mex seasonings.	neg
This recipe is a little spicy, but feel free to skip the serranos and substitute a packaged taco seasoning mixture for the spices, especially if you’re cooking for kids.	neg
Many taco seasoning mixes, such as Old El Paso and Ortega, come in your choice of spicy or mild.	neg
This summery, Greek-inspired dinner comes together in a snap with the help of a grill basket.	neg
This recipe can easily be doubled to serve four, either by cooking in two batches or using two grill baskets.	neg
Everything for this simple, Spanish-inspired dish gets tossed in the same lemon, garlic, and smoked paprika marinade, then cooked in a grill basket for an easier, faster way to grill dinner.	neg
This recipe can easily be doubled to serve four, either by cooking in two batches or using two grill baskets.	neg
Looking for an easy way to serve eggs to a crowd?	neg
Use a blender to quickly whisk the eggs together, then bake on a sheet pan until the texture is custardy—more like a frittata than scrambled eggs.	neg
Slice and serve in breakfast sandwiches, stuff inside grilled cheese, add more protein to quesadillas and wraps, or serve with bacon or sausage on the side or over toast with sliced avocado.	neg
Cool romaine lettuce and barbecue-flavored chickpeas combine to create great flavor and texture in this hearty pita sandwich.	neg
This pairs well with many simple companions—potatoes or sweet potatoes, fresh corn, a simple quinoa salad or pilaf, or a light soup.	neg
And steamed green veggies are always welcome, too.	neg
Though I’m all for high-quality prepared sauces and such to use as shortcuts, I’ve never found a bottled vegan barbecue sauce I really like.	neg
But this nearly instant sauce is so easy that I’ve ended the search.	neg
It’s especially good with tofu, tempeh, and seitan.	neg
I’ve already admitted that I’m usually too lazy to make pizza dough from scratch, what with good, natural brands of prepared crust so widely available.	neg
Once in a blue moon, though, I like to indulge; it’s really not that difficult.	neg
This is a recipe I’ve relied on for years when those blue moons come along.	neg
If you want boozier pops, increase the gin to 1/3 cup.	neg
They will still freeze but not quite as hard, and they will get slushy quickly once unmolded.	neg
There’s no need to roll these super-thin.	neg
In fact, a little heft keeps them moist.	neg
Japanese sweet potatoes are starchier than yams and worth seeking out. Steaming before grilling keeps them moist.	neg
Don’t fuss with the salmon too much once it’s on the grill: Let the flesh naturally release from the grate before attempting to turn it.	neg
You can also use the tare marinade for any cut of salmon.	neg
To make these cakes, I use the reverse creaming method, as opposed to the more common creaming method.	neg
Instead of beating air into the sugar and butter, adding the eggs then stirring in the dry ingredients, the reverse creaming method requires the butter to be rubbed into the dry ingredients, followed by milk and eggs.	neg
As well as being simpler, with fewer stages, I think this method produces a better textured, more even sponge.	neg
When you rub the butter into the flour and sugar, the flour particles get coated in fat, which minimizes gluten formation in the cake.	neg
Gluten is the essential component in bread, but in cakes too much can produce a tough and chewy sponge.	neg
The ingredients for a meringue are very simple; you need double the weight of sugar to egg whites.	neg
It is easy to make any quantity of meringue if you follow this 2:1 ratio.	neg
This taco salad is very different from the taco salads that my mom used to order at Mexican restaurants. They were the lightest option on the menu, but I always found myself wondering, how do those giant fried tortillas hold up to all the cheese and sour cream?	neg
Here’s my fresher, vegetarian version of those taco salads, which serves as a balanced, full meal in a bowl.	neg
Crisp romaine and peppery arugula tossed in a creamy, intentionally zippy avocado-lime dressing form the base.	neg
Chili-flavored quinoa and black beans make it plenty hearty, while tomatoes, radishes, and avocado lend some color and pops of flavor.	neg
The ode to my mom's taco salads wouldn’t be complete without some crispy tortilla strips on top.	neg
Make this salad ahead of time to allow the flavors to become bolder.	neg
This is delicious in a bowl as a refreshing summer meal.	neg
Or serve this on top of a plate of assorted greens or bowl of cooked grains, rolled up in a tortilla, or as a topping for baked potatoes.	neg
Salade Niçoise is a beautifully composed salad of French origin that looks fancy but is incredibly easy to make.	neg
The traditional version is often made with tuna, but here the fish is replaced with baked tofu, which makes a great stand-in.	neg
And the array of ingredients—white beans or chickpeas, slender green beans, tomatoes, and olives—makes it a splendid main dish salad for a summer meal, either on busy weeknights or festive occasions.	neg
Packaged baked tofu is tasty and not all that expensive, but homemade baked tofu is even better.	neg
The trick to this chewy, savory transformation of bland white tofu is to make sure it’s well pressed and to let it marinate for plenty of time.	neg
These baked tofu slices are so flavorful that you can serve them as a side dish, add them to the dinner plate for extra protein, or use them to make sandwiches on toast or rolls along with vegan mayonnaise and/or mustard and sprouts or dark green lettuce.	neg
They also make a fantastic addition to wraps.	neg
Large jagged sheets of chicharrón, or pork crackling, can be found at any Mexico City market.	neg
It's most often eaten as a snack—as a crunchy vehicle for guacamole and salsas—or in a guisado, when it's drenched in salsa and cooked until soggy, then spooned into a tortilla.	neg
Most vendors sell two varieties: light and puffy with no fat or meat clinging to the skin, and a meaty, fatty version.	neg
Only in the outskirts of the city have I seen homemade chicharrón and it turns out it's not too difficult to make.	neg
Homemade chicharrón is wonderful with pico de gallo, any salsa, guacamole, or cooked in green sauce and served in a taco when soft.	neg
I've kept the pieces large on purpose here, as it's customary in Mexico to break off a piece with your hands, then dip it in a salsa or guacamole.	neg
When you have a chocolate glaze recipe that’s as versatile and simple as this one is, it’s easy to rely on it time and again.	neg
It’s so quick to prepare that you can wait until the last minute to mix it up.	neg
Or you can make it ahead and reheat it to a pourable consistency when you need it.	neg
This makes a hefty amount, so if you don’t use all of it, just store the leftovers in a sealed container and refrigerate until needed.	neg
In Epi's 3-Ingredient Recipes series, we show you how to make great food with just three ingredients (plus staples like oil, salt, and pepper).	neg

A simple Buffalo-style hot sauce delivers a big punch of flavor to these addictive grilled wings.	neg

We love Halloumi’s squeaky texture, but some torn salted mozzarella would be just as good (just don’t try grilling it).	neg
In Epi's 3-Ingredient Recipes series, we show you how to make great food with just three ingredients (plus staples like oil, salt, and pepper).	neg
Crisp-tender grilled green beans on a bed of creamy whipped ricotta is the ultimate summer side, super-simple but elegant enough for company.	neg
Add some grilled bread for a fun family-style appetizer.	neg
The classic iced tea and lemonade combo (aka the Arnold Palmer) is transformed into a boozy frozen cocktail perfect for backyard parties and barbecues. Freezing the drink components into ice cubes before blending is an easy way to keep the flavors concentrated.	neg
Central New York State is known for sandwiches stuffed with juicy skewered meat marinated in Italian dressing; these are tasty enough to serve straight up, but we wouldn’t stop you from putting them on soft Italian bread, either.	neg
Let it rain with the kosher salt—for the best flavor, you want to season these simple steaks really well before they get grilled.	neg
Great with Garlicky Harissa or Charred Tomatillo Chermoula.	neg
In Epi's 3-Ingredient Recipes series, we show you how to make great food with just three ingredients (plus staples like oil, salt, and pepper).	neg
Find a great prepared pesto and you can have dinner in no time!	neg
In this easy grilled dinner, the pesto works as both a simple marinade for the chicken and a finishing sauce.	neg
Grilling the peaches caramelizes their natural sugars and adds a smoky flavor to the stone fruit, turning them into a delicious side.	neg
In Epi's 3-Ingredient Recipes series, we show you how to make great food with just three ingredients (plus staples like oil, salt, and pepper).	neg
A fresh, bright pineapple dressing ties together this irresistible platter of grilled pineapple rings, strip steak, and creamy avocado.	neg
When I first dreamed up this sandwich, I wanted the maple butter to go on the bread before it went into the waffle iron, but that turned out to be a recipe for disaster: The sugars in the maple syrup burned quickly, much more quickly than the cheese melted.	neg
There would have to be another way.	neg
And there is!	neg
After a few modifications, I hit on the right balance of pre- and post-buttering.	neg
There’s still room for pre-buttering, just hold the maple syrup on that step. Buttering the bread	neg
before you waffle it ensures a crispy, golden brown exterior.	neg
Adding the maple butter right as the sandwich comes out of the waffle iron means the sweet, rich mixture soaks into the still-warm bread.	neg
Leftover mac and cheese is not exactly one of life’s biggest problems, but if it happens to you, here’s what to do.	neg
Iced tea with tapioca pearls that are sucked from a large straw are perhaps Taiwan’s most famous culinary export.	neg
These bouncy, chewy balls are fun to munch on, much like chewing gum.	neg
The teas may be milky or not, sweetened or not, and flavored with any number of additional powders or infusions, like mango.	neg
My favorite style is this classic black tea with milk, and sweetened.	neg
You'll need your favorite seafood seasoning and your biggest pot for this boil (also called Frogmore Stew, One-Pot, or Farmer's Seafood Boil) brimming with plump shrimp, sweet corn, smoky sausage, and tender potatoes.	neg
Call all your friends and spread out some newspaper for a fun, roll-up-your-sleeves meal that will feed a crowd.	neg
In Epi's 3-Ingredient Recipes series, we show you how to make great food with just three ingredients (plus staples like oil, salt, and pepper).	neg
Grilling the watermelon adds a savory depth to the fruit, giving this refreshing summer salad much more flavor than you’d imagine from this simple combination.	neg
This simple jam is full of fresh peach flavor with hints of vanilla and bourbon.	neg
For this dessert recipe, the dough for fregolotta, an Italian cookie, is broken up into small pieces, then baked.	neg
And you may end up with some extra.	neg
Save it in an airtight container at room temperature for up to three days.	neg
It’s great over ice cream and Nutella.	neg
A luxurious almond cream makes this one-hour summer stone fruit dessert taste like an all-day labor of love.	neg
Roasting the eggplants at a high heat will make the flesh very tender while making the skin a little crispy.	neg
This recipe is from Gunpowder, an Indian restaurant in London.	neg
These rice balls have no filling or nori.	neg
Instead, once compactly formed, they are brushed with soy or miso and broiled until they are crispy and chewy on the outside and soft on the inside.	neg
These onigiri are delicious hot.	neg
It’s a lot of onion!	neg
But it will cook down quite a bit, so it’s best to start with a large quantity.	neg
You can use a skillet to cook the onions, but a pan with high sides will keep the onions from flipping out onto your stove.	neg
Using a pan that also has a wide base gives water room to evaporate, allowing the onions to caramelize rather than steam.	neg
If the tail sticks out of the pan a bit, it’s not a huge deal.	neg
You have some choices with shape.	neg
You can make a purse, tortellini or traditional triangle wontons.	neg
The sauce should have a balance of hot, sweet, sour, and salty, which is typical of Thai foods.	neg
This will produce a more leathery result.	neg
Either way is good!	neg
It should lighten in color and thicken enough that it holds an edge when the whisk is dragged through it.	neg
The oysters should be fried within just a few moments of coating them.	neg
When it is ready, the butter should be smooth, soft, but still cool—not warm, oily, or greasy.	neg
Placing them on top of the coals will cause them to burn too quickly; you want the wood to catch slowly and smolder.	neg
This will help draw the smoke up and over the meat as it rises.	neg
You may hear a crack.	neg
This means you're doing it right.	neg
Salsa can be made 1 day ahead.	neg
Muffins can be made 3 days ahead.	neg
This will eventually become your crust.	neg
The next step is a bit tricky.	neg
The crust will rise significantly.	neg
I cook all my pizzas until they’re well done, which could take up to 10 minutes total (sometimes less).	neg
It may blacken in spots, and that’s okay.	neg
Hummus can be made 1 week ahead.	neg
Lucky you.	neg
It will keep in the fridge for 12 months or more.	neg
The bottom may still be slightly moist with fat.	neg
If you bite into a piece, you should be able to see a very thin core of uncooked pasta.	neg
Temperature will be lower at higher elevations.	neg
Jam can be refrigerated for up to 2 months	neg

every time you look , sweet home alabama is taking another bummer of a wrong turn .	neg
partway through watching this saccharine , easter-egg-colored concoction , you realize that it is made up of three episodes of a rejected tv show .	neg
the overall effect is less like a children's movie than a recruitment film for future hollywood sellouts .	neg
portentous and pretentious , the weight of water is appropriately titled , given the heavy-handedness of it drama .	neg
a fitfully amusing romp that , if nothing else , will appeal to fans of malcolm in the middle and its pubescent star , frankie muniz .	neg
jason x is positively anti-darwinian : nine sequels and 400 years later , the teens are none the wiser and jason still kills on auto-pilot .	neg
to say this was done better in wilder's some like it hot is like saying the sun rises in the east .	neg
at the very least , if you don't know anything about derrida when you walk into the theater , you won't know much more when you leave .	neg
the actors are appealing , but elysian fields is idiotic and absurdly sentimental .	neg
as 'chick flicks' go , this one is pretty miserable , resorting to string-pulling rather than legitimate character development and intelligent plotting .	neg
the only excitement comes when the credits finally roll and you get to leave the theater .	neg
there's no emotional pulse to solaris . with an emotional sterility to match its outer space setting , soderbergh's spectacular swing for the fence yields only a spectacular whiff .	neg
it can't decide if it wants to be a mystery/thriller , a romance or a comedy .	neg
denis o'neill's script avoids the prime sports cliche , a last-second goal to win the championship , but it neglects few others .	neg
the character of zigzag is not sufficiently developed to support a film constructed around him .	neg
one of those pictures whose promising , if rather precious , premise is undercut by amateurish execution .	neg
serving sara doesn't serve up a whole lot of laughs .	neg
the most hopelessly monotonous film of the year , noteworthy only for the gimmick of being filmed as a single unbroken 87-minute take .	neg
with virtually no interesting elements for an audience to focus on , chelsea walls is a triple-espresso endurance challenge .	neg
stale , futile scenario .	neg
deadeningly dull , mired in convoluted melodrama , nonsensical jargon and stiff-upper-lip laboriousness .	neg
a misogynistic piece of filth that attempts to pass itself off as hip , young adult entertainment .	neg
like the chelsea's denizens . . . burdette's collage-form scenario tends to over-romanticize the spiritual desolation of the struggling artiste .	neg
it's basically an overlong episode of tales from the crypt .	neg
the film makes a fatal mistake : it asks us to care about a young man whose only apparent virtue is that he is not quite as unpleasant as some of the people in his life .	neg
another in-your-face wallow in the lower depths made by people who have never sung those blues .	neg
shaky close-ups of turkey-on-rolls , stubbly chins , liver spots , red noses and the filmmakers new bobbed do draw easy chuckles but lead nowhere .	neg
i can't quite recommend it -- it's too patched together -- but i almost can ; it's the kind of movie that makes you want to like it .	neg
complete lack of originality , cleverness or even visible effort	neg
though perry and hurley make inspiring efforts to breathe life into the disjointed , haphazard script by jay scherick and david ronn , neither the actors nor director reginald hudlin can make it more than fitfully entertaining .	neg
something akin to a japanese alice through the looking glass , except that it seems to take itself far more seriously .	neg
it takes talent to make a lifeless movie about the most heinous man who ever lived .	neg
on the whole , the movie lacks wit , feeling and believability to compensate for its incessant coarseness and banality .	neg
the story and the friendship proceeds in such a way that you're watching a soap opera rather than a chronicle of the ups and downs that accompany lifelong friendships .	neg
offers very little genuine romance and even fewer laughs . . . a sad sitcom of a movie , largely devoid of charm .	neg
makes for a pretty unpleasant viewing experience .	neg
the movie fails to live up to the sum of its parts .	neg
although huppert's intensity and focus has a raw exhilaration about it , the piano teacher is anything but fun .	neg
it showcases carvey's talent for voices , but not nearly enough and not without taxing every drop of one's patience to get to the good stuff .	neg
bad . very bad . stultifyingly , dumbfoundingly , mind-numbingly bad .	neg
may reawaken discussion of the kennedy assassination but this fictional film looks made for cable rather than for the big screen .	neg
if looking for a thrilling sci-fi cinematic ride , don't settle for this imposter .	neg
not really bad so much as distasteful : we need kidnapping suspense dramas right now like we need doomsday thrillers .	neg
the result is a gaudy bag of stale candy , something from a halloween that died .	neg
davis . . . is so enamored of her own creation that she can't see how insufferable the character is .	neg
the man from elysian fields is a cold , bliss-less work that groans along thinking itself some important comment on how life throws us some beguiling curves .	neg
the messages of compassion and mercy are clearly , squarely and specifically expounded via computer animated old testament tale of jonah and the whale . determined to be fun , and bouncy , with energetic musicals , the humor didn't quite engage this adult .	neg
historical dramas fused with love triangle is a well worn conceit . but this films lacks the passion required to sell the material .	neg
long time dead ? not nearly long enough .	neg
nothing more substantial than a fitfully clever doodle .	neg
a solid film . . . but more conscientious than it is truly stirring .	neg
there's not enough here to justify the almost two hours .	neg
the x potion gives the quickly named blossom , bubbles and buttercup supernatural powers that include extraordinary strength and laser-beam eyes , which unfortunately don't enable them to discern flimsy screenplays .	neg
perceptive in its vision of nascent industrialized world politics as a new art form , but far too clunky , didactic and saddled with scenes that seem simply an ill fit for this movie .	neg
verbinski implements every hack-artist trick to give us the ooky-spookies .	neg
mcconaughey's fun to watch , the dragons are okay , not much fire in the script .	neg
an unwise amalgam of broadcast news and vibes .	neg
skins has a right to yawp , and we have a right to our grains of salt .	neg
who needs love like this ?	neg
hit and miss as far as the comedy goes and a big ole' miss in the way of story .	neg
returning aggressively to his formula of dimwitted comedy and even dimmer characters , sandler , who also executive produces , has made a film that makes previous vehicles look smart and sassy .	neg
exists then as an occasionally insightful acting exercise .	neg
trite , banal , cliched , mostly inoffensive .	neg
mattei is tiresomely grave and long-winded , as if circularity itself indicated profundity .	neg
it's not original , and , robbed of the element of surprise , it doesn't have any huge laughs in its story of irresponsible cops who love to play pranks .	neg
whenever its story isn't bogged down by idiocy involving the cia and a lost u . s . satellite , hunter -- starring irwin and his american wife/colleague , terri -- is a movie children should enjoy .	neg
it offers little beyond the momentary joys of pretty and weightless intellectual entertainment .	neg
a sequence of ridiculous shoot-'em-up scenes .	neg
nothing in waking up in reno ever inspired me to think of its inhabitants as anything more than markers in a screenplay .	neg
i'm just too bored to care .	neg
irwin is a man with enough charisma and audacity to carry a dozen films , but this particular result is ultimately held back from being something greater .	neg
not a stereotype is omitted nor a cliché left unsaid .	neg
as befits its title , this pg-13-rated piffle is ultimately as threatening as the snuggle fabric softener bear .	neg
attempts by this ensemble film to impart a message are so heavy-handed that they instead pummel the audience .	neg
it all feels like a monty python sketch gone horribly wrong .	neg
nervous breakdowns are not entertaining .	neg
scorsese doesn't give us a character worth giving a damn about .	neg
a beautifully made piece of unwatchable drivel .	neg
like being trapped at a perpetual frat party . . . how can something so gross be so boring ?	neg
this is so bad .	neg
even film silliness needs a little gravity , beyond good hair and humping .	neg
i felt sad for lise not so much because of what happens as because she was captured by this movie when she obviously belongs in something lighter and sunnier , by rohmer , for example .	neg
prurient playthings aside , there's little to love about this english trifle .	neg
this is a train wreck of an action film -- a stupefying attempt by the filmmakers to force-feed james bond into the mindless xxx mold and throw 40 years of cinematic history down the toilet in favor of bright flashes and loud bangs .	neg
the film flat lines when it should peak and is more missed opportunity and trifle than dark , decadent truffle .	neg
it's played in the most straight-faced fashion , with little humor to lighten things up . the heavy-handed film is almost laughable as a consequence .	neg
van wilder brings a whole new meaning to the phrase 'comedy gag . ' at least one scene is so disgusting that viewers may be hard pressed to retain their lunch .	neg
a disappointment for those who love alternate versions of the bard , particularly ones that involve deep fryers and hamburgers .	neg
the film tries too hard to be funny and tries too hard to be hip . the end result is a film that's neither .	neg
every nanosecond of the the new guy reminds you that you could be doing something else far more pleasurable . something like scrubbing the toilet . or emptying rat traps . or doing last year's taxes with your ex-wife .	neg
scooby dooby doo / and shaggy too / you both look and sound great . / but daphne , you're too buff / fred thinks he's tough / and velma - wow , you've lost weight !	neg
is the time really ripe for a warmed-over james bond adventure , with a village idiot as the 007 clone ?	neg
there's enough melodrama in this magnolia primavera to make pta proud yet director muccino's characters are less worthy of puccini than they are of daytime television .	neg
however it may please those who love movies that blare with pop songs , young science fiction fans will stomp away in disgust .	neg
the humor isn't as sharp , the effects not as innovative , nor the story as imaginative as in the original . but it could have been worse .	neg
some of their jokes work , but most fail miserably and in the end , pumpkin is far more offensive than it is funny .	neg
even horror fans will most likely not find what they're seeking with trouble every day ; the movie lacks both thrills and humor .	neg
comes off like a rejected abc afterschool special , freshened up by the dunce of a screenwriting 101 class . . . . designed to provide a mix of smiles and tears , " crossroads " instead provokes a handful of unintentional howlers and numerous yawns .	neg
it seems to me the film is about the art of ripping people off without ever letting them consciously know you have done so	neg
it's just disappointingly superficial -- a movie that has all the elements necessary to be a fascinating , involving character study , but never does more than scratch the surface .	neg
the title not only describes its main characters , but the lazy people behind the camera as well .	neg
sometimes it feels as if it might have been made in the '70s or '80s , and starred chevy chase and goldie hawn .	neg
schaeffer has to find some hook on which to hang his persistently useless movies , and it might as well be the resuscitation of the middle-aged character .	neg
demands too much of most viewers .	neg
the story drifts so inexorably into cliches about tortured ( and torturing ) artists and consuming but impossible love that you can't help but become more disappointed as each overwrought new sequence plods on .	neg
it should be mentioned that the set design and interiors of the haunted vessel are more than effectively creepy and moodily lit . so i just did .	neg
shamelessly sappy and , worse , runs away from its own provocative theme .	neg
aggravating and tedious .	neg
the ring just left me cold and wet like i was out in the seattle drizzle without rainwear .	neg
the film seems a dead weight . the lack of pace kills it , although , in a movie about cancer , this might be apt .	neg
for anyone who grew up on disney's 1950 treasure island , or remembers the 1934 victor fleming classic , this one feels like an impostor .	neg
a clutchy , indulgent and pretentious travelogue and diatribe against . . . well , just stuff . watching scarlet diva , one is poised for titillation , raw insight or both . instead , we just get messy anger , a movie as personal therapy .	neg
meandering , sub-aquatic mess : it's so bad it's good , but only if you slide in on a freebie .	neg
the ending is a cop-out . what happens to john q ? i don't have an i am sam clue .	neg
has the feel of an unedited personal journal .	neg
remember when bond had more glamour than clamor ? no more .	neg
cry havoc and let slip the dogs of cheese , indeed .	neg
this charmless nonsense ensues amid clanging film references that make jay and silent bob's excellent adventure seem understated .	neg
it doesn't quite deserve the gong , but there are more fascinating acts than " confessions of a dangerous mind . "	neg
the subject of swinging still seems ripe for a documentary -- just not this one .	neg
 . . . hudlin is stuck trying to light a fire with soggy leaves .	neg
unlike his directorial efforts , la femme nikita and the professional , the transporter lacks besson's perspective as a storyteller .	neg
the overall effect is so completely inane that one would have to be mighty bored to even think of staying with this for more than , say , ten . . . make that three minutes .	neg
lacks depth .	neg
most of the supporting characters in eastwood films are weak , as are most of the subplots . this one's weaker than most .	neg
there's no real reason to see it , and no real reason not to .	neg
audiences will find no mention of political prisoners or persecutions that might paint the castro regime in less than saintly tones .	neg
under-rehearsed and lifeless	neg
the film takes too long getting to the good stuff , then takes too long figuring out what to do next .	neg
you can practically smell the patchouli oil .	neg
to say analyze that is de niro's best film since meet the parents sums up the sad state of his recent career .	neg
the actors don't inhabit their roles -- they're trapped by them , forced to change behavior in bizarre unjustified fashion and spout dialog that consists mostly of platitudes .	neg
an often-deadly boring , strange reading of a classic whose witty dialogue is treated with a baffling casual approach	neg
this film was made to get laughs from the slowest person in the audience -- just pure slapstick with lots of inane , inoffensive screaming and exaggerated facial expressions .	neg
consists of a plot and jokes done too often by people far more talented than ali g	neg
another week , another gross-out college comedy--ugh .	neg
laughably , irredeemably awful .	neg
moderately involving despite bargain-basement photography and hackneyed romance .	neg
there is no insight into the anguish of heidi's life -- only a depiction of pain , today's version of greek tragedy , the talk-show guest decrying her fate .	neg
the editing is chaotic , the photography grainy and badly focused , the writing unintentionally hilarious , the direction unfocused , the performances as wooden .	neg
when [de palma's] bad , he's really bad , and femme fatale ranks with the worst he has done .	neg
tadpole is emblematic of the witless ageism afflicting films : young is cool , and too young is too cool .	neg
i doubt anyone will remember the picture by the time christmas really rolls around , but maybe it'll be on video by then .	neg
uncertain in tone . . . a garbled exercise in sexual politics , a junior varsity short cuts by way of very bad things .	neg
all's well that ends well , and rest assured , the consciousness-raising lessons are cloaked in gross-out gags .	neg
the only thing worse than your substandard , run-of-the-mill hollywood picture is an angst-ridden attempt to be profound .	neg
if you think that jennifer lopez has shown poor judgment in planning to marry ben affleck , wait till you see maid in manhattan .	neg
stars matthew perry and elizabeth hurley illicit more than a chuckle , and more jokes land than crash , but ultimately serving sara doesn't distinguish itself from the herd .	neg
it's best to avoid imprisonment with the dull , nerdy folks that inhabit cherish .	neg
culkin exudes none of the charm or charisma that might keep a more general audience even vaguely interested in his bratty character .	neg
in the end , ted bundy's only justification is the director's common but unexplored fascination with the frustrated maniac ; there's no larger point , and little social context .	neg
 . . . ( like ) channel surfing between the discovery channel and a late-night made-for-cable action movie .	neg
a movie that , rather than skip along the seine , more or less slogs its way through soggy paris , tongue uncomfortably in cheek .	neg
shot perhaps 'artistically' with handheld cameras and apparently no movie lights by joaquin baca-asay , the low-budget production swings annoyingly between vertigo and opacity .	neg
imagine a really bad community theater production of west side story without the songs .	neg
soul is what's lacking in every character in this movie and , subsequently , the movie itself .	neg
a one-trick pony whose few t&a bits still can't save itself from being unoriginal , unfunny and unrecommendable .	neg
the worst kind of independent ; the one where actors play dress down hicks and ponderously mope around trying to strike lightning as captured by their 1970s predecessors	neg
it may be a prize winner , but teacher is a bomb .	neg
the production values are up there . the use of cgi and digital ink-and-paint make the thing look really slick . the voices are fine as well . the problem , it is with most of these things , is the script .	neg
it's got its heart in the right place , but it also wilts after awhile .	neg
proves that a movie about goodness is not the same thing as a good movie .	neg
well , it does go on forever .	neg
this overproduced and generally disappointing effort isn't likely to rouse the rush hour crowd .	neg
topkapi this is not .	neg
if shayamalan wanted to tell a story about a man who loses his faith , why didn't he just do it , instead of using bad sci-fi as window dressing ?	neg
ethan hawke has always fancied himself the bastard child of the beatnik generation and it's all over his chelsea walls .	neg
equal parts bodice-ripper and plodding costume drama .	neg
i'm not suggesting that you actually see it , unless you're the kind of person who has seen every wim wenders film of the '70s .	neg
while the film misfires at every level , the biggest downside is the paucity of laughter in what's supposed to be a comedy .	neg
if you liked the 1982 film then , you'll still like it now .	neg
a 93-minute condensation of a 26-episode tv series , with all of the pitfalls of such you'd expect .	neg
guillen rarely gets beneath the surface of things . she lists ingredients , but never mixes and stirs .	neg
audiences can be expected to suspend their disbelief only so far -- and that does not include the 5 o'clock shadow on the tall wooden kid as he skips off to school .	neg
to imagine the life of harry potter as a martial arts adventure told by a lobotomized woody allen is to have some idea of the fate that lies in store for moviegoers lured to the mediocrity that is kung pow : enter the fist .	neg
it delivers some chills and sustained unease , but flounders in its quest for deeper meaning .	neg
credibility levels are low and character development a non-starter .	neg
i would have preferred a transfer down the hall to mr . holland's class for the music , or to robin williams's lecture so i could listen to a teacher with humor , passion , and verve .	neg
for the most part , the ingredients are there . but an unwillingness to explore beyond the surfaces of her characters prevents nettelbeck's film from coming together .	neg
an earnest , heartrending look at the divide between religious fundamentalists and their gay relatives . it's also heavy-handed and devotes too much time to bigoted views .	neg
a mawkish , implausible platonic romance that makes chaplin's city lights seem dispassionate by comparison .	neg
yes , one enjoys seeing joan grow from awkward young woman to strong , determined monarch , but her love for the philandering philip only diminishes her stature .	neg
it's a film that hinges on its casting , and glover really doesn't fit the part .	neg
this is a throwaway , junk-food movie whose rap soundtrack was better tended to than the film itself .	neg
 . . . with the candy-like taste of it fading faster than 25-cent bubble gum , i realized this is a throwaway movie that won't stand the test of time . it's a trifle .	neg
literally nothing in the pool is new , but if you grew up on the stalker flicks of the 1980's this one should appease you for 90 minutes .	neg
arguably the year's silliest and most incoherent movie .	neg
anyway , for one reason or another , crush turns into a dire drama partway through . after that , it just gets stupid and maudlin . too bad , but thanks to some lovely comedic moments and several fine performances , it's not a total loss .	neg
chao was chen kaige's assistant for years in china . he has not learnt that storytelling is what the movies are about .	neg
a mixed bag of a comedy that can't really be described as out of this world .	neg
unwieldy contraption .	neg
the film is a travesty of the genre and even as spoof takes itself too seriously .	neg
marries the amateurishness of the blair witch project with the illogic of series 7 : the contenders to create a completely crass and forgettable movie .	neg
the piano teacher is the sort of movie that discourages american audiences from ever wanting to see another foreign film .	neg
if it's another regurgitated action movie you're after , there's no better film than half past dead .	neg
so what is the point ? lovingly choreographed bloodshed taking place in a pristine movie neverland , basically .	neg
this is junk food cinema at its greasiest .	neg
when it's all wet , blue crush is highly enjoyable . when it's on dry land , though , this surfer-girl melodrama starts gasping like a beached grouper .	neg
most new movies have a bright sheen . some , like ballistic , arrive stillborn . . . looking like the beaten , well-worn video box cover of seven years into the future .	neg
the story is naturally poignant , but first-time screenwriter paul pender overloads it with sugary bits of business .	neg
you see robert de niro singing - and dancing to - west side story show tunes . choose your reaction : a . ) that sure is funny ! b . ) that sure is pathetic !	neg
a sermonizing and lifeless paean to teenage dullards .	neg
this dramatically shaky contest of wills only reiterates the old hollywood saw : evil is interesting and good is boring .	neg
before long , the film starts playing like general hospital crossed with a saturday night live spoof of dog day afternoon .	neg
the charms of willful eccentricity , at least as evidenced by this latest cinematic essay , are beginning to wear a bit thin .	neg
instead of accurately accounting a terrible true story , the film's more determined to become the next texas chainsaw massacre . but what about the countless other people who'd merely like to watch a solid tale about a universally interesting soul ?	neg
a silly , self-indulgent film about a silly , self-indulgent filmmaker .	neg
scarlet diva has a voyeuristic tug , but all in all it's a lot less sensational than it wants to be .	neg
the character is too forced and overwritten to be funny or believable much of the time , and clayburgh doesn't always improve the over-the-top mix .	neg
flashy , pretentious and as impenetrable as morvern's thick , working-class scottish accent .	neg
a battle between bug-eye theatre and dead-eye matinee .	neg
the movie is virtually without context -- journalistic or historical . what's worse is that pelosi knows it .	neg
 . . . instead go rent " shakes the clown " , a much funnier film with a similar theme and an equally great robin williams performance .	neg
lame , haphazard teen comedy .	neg
it's the kind of movie that ends up festooning u . s . art house screens for no reason other than the fact that it's in french ( well , mostly ) with english subtitles and is magically 'significant' because of that .	neg
this miserable excuse of a movie runs on empty , believing flatbush machismo will get it through .	neg
expect to be reminded of other , better films , especially seven , which director william malone slavishly copies .	neg
nair stuffs the film with dancing , henna , ornamentation , and group song , but her narrative clichés and telegraphed episodes smell of old soap opera .	neg
it's getting harder and harder to ignore the fact that hollywood isn't laughing with us , folks . it's laughing at us .	neg
might have been better off as a documentary , with less of mr . eyre's uninspired dramatics and more of his sense of observation and outrage .	neg
every good actor needs to do his or her own hamlet . for benigni it wasn't shakespeare whom he wanted to define his career with but pinocchio . it might as well have been problem child iv .	neg
arnold's jump from little screen to big will leave frowns on more than a few faces .	neg
both awful and appealing .	neg
the lack of opposing viewpoints soon grows tiresome -- the film feels more like a series of toasts at a testimonial dinner than a documentary .	neg
nothing plot-wise is worth e-mailing home about .	neg
we are left with a superficial snapshot that , however engaging , is insufficiently enlightening and inviting .	neg
helmer devito . . . attempts to do too many things in this story about ethics , payola , vice , murder , kids' tv and revenge .	neg
it wouldn't be my preferred way of spending 100 minutes or $7 . 00 .	neg
i hated every minute of it .	neg
[t]hose same extremes prevent us from taking its message seriously , and the stepford wives mentality doesn't work in a modern context .	neg
obvious politics and rudimentary animation reduce the chances that the appeal of hey arnold ! the movie will reach far beyond its core demographic .	neg
there's no mistaking the fact that this hybrid misses the impact of the disney classic , and even that of the excellent 1934 mgm version .	neg
a simple , sometimes maddeningly slow film that has just enough charm and good acting to make it interesting , but is ultimately pulled under by the pacing and lack of creativity within .	neg
roger michell , who did an appealing job directing persuasion and notting hill in england , gets too artsy in his american debut .	neg
there is an almost poignant dimension to the way that every major stunt seagal's character . . . performs is shot from behind , as if it could fool us into thinking that we're not watching a double .	neg
anthony hopkins ? big deal ! we've already seen the prequel to the silence of the lambs and hannibal -- and it was better the first time .	neg
ostensibly celebrates middle-aged girl power , even as it presents friendship between women as pathetic , dysfunctional and destructive .	neg
if this is an example of the type of project that robert redford's lab is willing to lend its imprimatur to , then perhaps it's time to rethink independent films .	neg
pumpkin sits in a patch somewhere between mirthless todd solondzian satire and callow student film .	neg
not so much funny as aggressively sitcom-cute , it's full of throwaway one-liners , not-quite jokes , and a determined tv amiability that allen personifies .	neg
it's not that waiting for happiness is a bad film , because it isn't . it's just incredibly dull .	neg
the sad thing about knockaround guys is its lame aspiration for grasping the coolness vibes when in fact the film isn't as flippant or slick as it thinks it is .	neg
a cumbersome and cliche-ridden movie greased with every emotional device known to man .	neg
director ferzan ozpetek creates an interesting dynamic with the members of this group , who live in the same apartment building . but he loses his focus when he concentrates on any single person .	neg
egoyan's movie is too complicated to sustain involvement , and , if you'll excuse a little critical heresy , too intellectually ambitious .	neg
it wants to be thought of as a subversive little indie film , but it has all the qualities of a modern situation comedy .	neg
despite apparent motives to the contrary , it ends up being , like [seinfeld's] revered tv show , about pretty much nothing .	neg
shadyac shoots his film like an m . night shyamalan movie , and he frequently maintains the same snail's pace ; he just forgot to add any genuine tension .	neg
plays less like a coming-of-age romance than an infomercial .	neg
there are a few laughs and clever sight gags scattered about , but not enough to make this anything more than another big-budget bust .	neg
the story's so preposterous that i didn't believe it for a second , despite the best efforts of everyone involved .	neg
i've heard that the fans of the first men in black have come away hating the second one . i wonder why . they felt like the same movie to me .	neg
despite her relentless vim and winsome facial symmetry , witherspoon is just too dialed-up to be america's sweetheart .	neg
an ultra-low-budget indie debut that smacks more of good intentions than talent .	neg
birot is a competent enough filmmaker , but her story has nothing fresh or very exciting about it .	neg
de niro and mcdormand give solid performances , but their screen time is sabotaged by the story's inability to create interest .	neg
even those of a single digit age will be able to recognize that this story is too goofy . . . even for disney .	neg
that is essentially what's missing from blackboards -- the sense of something bigger , some ultimate point .	neg
a compendium of solondz's own worst instincts in under 90 minutes .	neg
if the title is a jeopardy question , then the answer might be " how does steven seagal come across these days ? " or maybe " how will you feel after an 88-minute rip-off of the rock with action confined to slo-mo gun firing and random glass-shattering ?	neg
it is a comedy that's not very funny and an action movie that is not very thrilling ( and an uneasy alliance , at that ) .	neg
the story is familiar from its many predecessors ; like them , it eventually culminates in the not-exactly -stunning insight that crime doesn't pay .	neg
you'll have more fun setting fire to yourself in the parking lot . you'll be more entertained getting hit by a bus .	neg
dissing a bond movie is quite like calling a dog stupid , but when it has the temerity to run over two hours , you feel like winding up with a kick .	neg
ritchie's treatment of the class reversal is majorly ham-fisted , from the repetitive manifestos that keep getting thrown in people's faces to the fact amber is such a joke .	neg
flat , but with a revelatory performance by michelle williams .	neg
little more than a frothy vanity project .	neg
the film goes from being an unusual sci-fi character study to a chase flick that detracts from its ending .	neg
verbinski substitutes atmosphere for action , tedium for thrills .	neg
for all its surface frenzy , high crimes should be charged with loitering -- so much on view , so little to offer .	neg
the sum of all fears is almost impossible to follow -- and there's something cringe-inducing about seeing an american football stadium nuked as pop entertainment .	neg
alex nohe's documentary plays like a travelogue for what mostly resembles a real-life , big-budget nc-17 version of tank girl .	neg
the title trapped turns out to be a pretty fair description of how you feel while you're watching this ultra-manipulative thriller .	neg
the appeal of the vulgar , sexist , racist humour went over my head or -- considering just how low brow it is -- perhaps it snuck under my feet .	neg
the story really has no place to go since simone is not real—she can't provide any conflict .	neg
ihops don't pile on this much syrup .	neg
for the most part , i spy was an amusing lark that will probably rank as one of murphy's better performances in one of his lesser-praised movies .	neg

with danilo donati's witty designs and dante spinotti's luscious cinematography , this might have made a decent children's movie -- if only benigni hadn't insisted on casting himself in the title role .	neg

this film is so slick , superficial and trend-hoppy , that it's easy to imagine that a new software program spit out the screenplay .	neg
just one more collection of penis , breast and flatulence gags in search of a story . or a profit . or some damn thing .	neg
the acting is stiff , the story lacks all trace of wit , the sets look like they were borrowed from gilligan's island -- and the cgi scooby might well be the worst special-effects creation of the year .	neg
enough trivializes an important crisis , reduces it to an almost comic embarrassment .	neg
the makers have forsaken the entertaining elements of the original and , instead , rehash old jokes and leave any life at the doorstep . i like frank the pug , though .	neg
a restrained ribisi convinces as an italian , though if ever a movie needed one of the actor's whiny jags to pump it up , this has to be among the rare ones .	neg

madonna still can't act a lick .	neg
even the imaginative gore can't hide the musty scent of todd farmer's screenplay , which is a simple retread of the 1979 alien , with a plucky heroine battling a monster loose in a spaceship .	neg
if you pitch your expectations at an all time low , you could do worse than this oddly cheerful -- but not particularly funny -- body-switching farce .	neg
the episodic film makes valid points about the depersonalization of modern life . but the characters tend to be cliches whose lives are never fully explored .	neg
serry does a fine job of capturing the climate of the times and , perhaps unwittingly , relating it to what is happening in america in 2002 . but hard-to-believe plot twists force the movie off track in its final half hour .	neg
don't let your festive spirit go this far .	neg
though the book runs only about 300 pages , it is so densely packed . . . that even an ambitious adaptation and elaborate production like mr . schepisi's seems skimpy and unclear .	neg

intended to be a comedy about relationships , this wretched work falls flat in just about every conceivable area .	neg
sensitive though not quite revelatory documentary .	neg
director brian levant , who never strays far from his sitcom roots , skates blithely from one implausible situation to another , pausing only to tie up loose ends with more bows than you'll find on a french poodle .	neg

i admire it and yet cannot recommend it , because it overstays its natural running time .	neg
a fairly by-the-books blend of action and romance with sprinklings of intentional and unintentional comedy .	neg
flounders due to the general sense that no two people working on the production had exactly the same thing in mind .	neg
even if you feel like you've seen this movie a thousand times before , it is kind of enjoyable thanks mainly to belushi's easy-going likableness .	neg
the story bogs down in a mess of purposeless violence .	neg

mckay deflates his piece of puffery with a sour cliche and heavy doses of mean-spiritedness	neg
a recipe for cinematic disaster . . . part quentin tarantino , part guy ritchie , and part 1960s spy spoof , it's all bad .	neg
the cumulative effect of the relentless horror on parade numbs the movie's power as a work of drama .	neg
another big , dumb action movie in the vein of xxx , the transporter is riddled with plot holes big enough for its titular hero to drive his sleek black bmw through .	neg
aaliyah rarely dampens her diva persona enough to spark genuine chemistry with townsend . when she speaks , her creepy egyptian demigod voice is as computer processed and overproduced as it was in her music .	neg
outrageousness is all plympton seemed to be going for this time . we miss the quirky amazement that used to come along for an integral part of the ride .	neg
much of what is meant to be 'inspirational' and 'uplifting' is simply distasteful to audiences not already sharing [the movie's] mindset .	neg
well before it's over , beijing bicycle begins spinning its wheels .	neg
home alone goes hollywood , a funny premise until the kids start pulling off stunts not even steven spielberg would know how to do . besides , real movie producers aren't this nice .	neg
[nelson's] movie about morally compromised figures leaves viewers feeling compromised , unable to find their way out of the fog and the ashes .	neg
passion , lip-synching , tragedy , and lots of really really high notes . for me , this opera isn't a favorite , so it's a long time before the fat lady sings .	neg
looks like a high school film project completed the day before it was due .	neg
truth to tell , if you've seen more than half-a-dozen horror films , there's nothing here you haven't seen before .	neg
abandons all pretense of creating historical context and waltzes off into a hectic soap about the ups and downs of the heavy breathing between the two artists .	neg
even die-hard fans of japanese animation . . . will find this one a challenge .	neg
filmmakers have to dig deep to sink this low . fortunately for all involved , this movie is likely to disappear as quickly as an ice cube thrown into a pot of boiling water .	neg
the movie gets muted and routine .	neg
the issue of faith is not explored very deeply	neg
it's a bad sign when you're rooting for the film to hurry up and get to its subjects' deaths just so the documentary will be over , but it's indicative of how uncompelling the movie is unless it happens to cover your particular area of interest .	neg
the situations and jokes are as predictable and as lowbrow as the endless pratfalls the boys take in their high heels .	neg
it's frustrating to see these guys -- who are obviously pretty clever -- waste their talent on parodies of things they probably thought were funniest when they were high .	neg

black-and-white and unrealistic .	neg
the film is like a series of beginnings and middles that never take off .	neg

ja rule and kurupt should have gotten to rap . it would have benefitted the dialogue .	neg
a standard haunted house tale transplanted to the high seas .	neg
elicits more groans from the audience than jar jar binks , scrappy doo and scooby dumb , all wrapped up into one .	neg
it's badly acted , blandly directed , and could have been scripted by someone who just graduated from elementary school .	neg
 in the end , white oleander isn't an adaptation of a novel . it's a flashy , star-splashed reduction .	neg
this film , starring anthony hopkins and chris rock , is your typical 'fish out of water' story . you've seen them a million times . just one problem : fish out of water usually die . this one does .	neg
the angst-ridden , affluent slacker characters are more grating than engaging .	neg
a soggy , shapeless mess . . . just a dumb excuse for a waterlogged equivalent of a haunted-house movie .	neg
men in black ii has sequel-itis something fierce . an ungainly , comedy-deficient , b-movie rush job . . .	neg
a combination of standard , stiff tv-style animation and snazzy-looking digital effects that do little to disguise the fact that the characters barely move .	neg
an unsatisfying hybrid of blair witch and typical stalk-and-slash fare , where the most conservative protagonist is always the last one living .	neg
say this for the soundtrack , it drowns out the lousy dialogue .	neg
after seeing swept away , i feel sorry for madonna .	neg
instead of kicking off the intrigue and suspense and mystery of the whole thing , hart's war , like the st . louis rams in the super bowl , waits until after halftime to get started .	neg
two-bit potboiler .	neg
a gob of drivel so sickly sweet , even the eager consumers of moore's pasteurized ditties will retch it up like rancid crème brûlée .	neg
maudlin and melodramatic we expected . boring we didn't .	neg
never quite transcends jokester status . . . and the punchline doesn't live up to barry's dead-eyed , perfectly chilled delivery .	neg
the film's bathos often overwhelms what could have been a more multifaceted look at this interesting time and place .	neg
it almost plays like solaris , but with guns and jokes .	neg
a baffling misfire , and possibly the weakest movie [woody allen] has made in the last twenty years .	neg
it won't be long before you'll spy i spy at a video store near you .	neg
this film looks like it was produced in 1954 , shelved for 48 years , and repackaged for a 2002 audience .	neg
propelled not by characters but by caricatures .	neg
there is not an ounce of honesty in the entire production .	neg
this extremely unfunny film clocks in at 80 minutes , but feels twice as long .	neg
earnest but earthbound . . . a slow , soggy , soporific , visually dank crime melodrama/character study that would be more at home on the small screen but for its stellar cast .	neg
the pivotal narrative point is so ripe the film can't help but go soft and stinky .	neg
for all its alleged youthful fire , xxx is no less subservient to bond's tired formula of guns , girls and gadgets while brandishing a new action hero .	neg
a predictable and stereotypical little b-movie .	neg
if i spy were funny ( enough ) or exciting ( enough ) then it would be fairly simple to forgive the financial extortion it's trying to reap from the moviegoing public .	neg
frustratingly , dridi tells us nothing about el gallo other than what emerges through his music .	neg
places a slightly believable love triangle in a difficult-to-swallow setting , and then disappointingly moves the story into the realm of an improbable thriller .	neg
stephen earnhart's documentary is a decomposition of healthy eccentric inspiration and ambition – wearing a cloak of unsentimental , straightforward text – when it's really an exercise in gross romanticization of the delusional personality type .	neg
a very average science fiction film .	neg
undone by its overly complicated and derivative screenplay , the glacier-paced direction and the stereotypical characters .	neg
how anyone over the age of 2 can stomach the touchy-feely message this preachy produce promotes is beyond us .	neg
the sort of movie that gives tastelessness a bad rap .	neg
the cold and dreary weather is a perfect metaphor for the movie itself , which contains few laughs and not much drama .	neg
the plot is straight off the shelf , the performances are television- caliber and the message of providing solace through deception is a little creepy .	neg
ordinary melodrama that is heavy on religious symbols but wafer-thin on dramatic substance	neg
a whimsical if predictable time-travel fable marred by a willful single-mindedness .	neg
those who managed to avoid the deconstructionist theorizing of french philosopher jacques derrida in college can now take an 85-minute brush-up course with the documentary derrida . or , you can do something fun tonight .	neg
jolie's performance vanishes somewhere between her hair and her lips .	neg
as with too many studio pics , plot mechanics get in the way of what should be the lighter-than-air adventure .	neg
static , repetitive , muddy and blurry , hey arnold ! would seem to have a lock on the title of ugliest movie of the year .	neg
for all of the contemporary post-colonialist consciousness that kapur tries to bring to the four feathers , the oddest thing about the movie is how it winds up affirming the same damn moldy values the material has always held dear .	neg
un thriller manqué qui tombe sur les nerfs presque dès la première image .	neg
when it comes to entertainment , children deserve better than pokemon 4ever .	neg
what the four feathers lacks is genuine sweep or feeling or even a character worth caring about .	neg
while benigni ( who stars and co-wrote ) seems to be having a wonderful time , he might be alone in that .	neg
yes , 4ever is harmless in the extreme and it'll mute your kids for nearly 80 minutes , but why not just treat the little yard apes to the real deal and take them to spirited away ?	neg
preposterous and tedious , sonny is spiked with unintentional laughter that , unfortunately , occurs too infrequently to make the film even a guilty pleasure .	neg
calling this movie brainless would be paying it a compliment : it's more like entertainment for trolls .	neg
none of these characters resembles anyone you've ever met in real life , unless you happen to know annoyingly self-involved people who speak in glib sentences that could have only come from the pen of a screenwriter .	neg
 . . . just a big mess of a movie , full of images and events , but no tension or surprise .	neg
as elegantly crafted as it often is , anderson's movie is essentially a one-trick pony that , hampered by an undeveloped script , ultimately pulls up lame .	neg
splashes its drama all over the screen , subjecting its audience and characters to action that feels not only manufactured , but also so false you can see the filmmakers' puppet strings .	neg
 . . . has virtually no script at all . . .	neg
will only satisfy those who can't tell the difference between the good , the bad and the ugly .	neg

even on its own ludicrous terms , the sum of all fears generates little narrative momentum , and invites unflattering comparisons to other installments in the ryan series .	neg
though it inspires some ( out-of-field ) creative thought , the film is -- to its own detriment -- much more a cinematic collage than a polemical tract .	neg
as predictable as the outcome of a globetrotters-generals game , juwanna mann is even more ludicrous than you'd expect from the guy-in-a-dress genre , and a personal low for everyone involved .	neg
sinks into the usual cafeteria goulash of fart jokes , masturbation jokes , and racist japanese jokes .	neg
where tom green stages his gags as assaults on america's knee-jerk moral sanctimony , jackass lacks aspirations of social upheaval .	neg
more of an intriguing curiosity than a gripping thriller .	neg
the april 2002 instalment of the american war for independence , complete with loads of cgi and bushels of violence , but not a drop of human blood .	neg
contains all the substance of a twinkie -- easy to swallow , but scarcely nourishing .	neg
return to neverland manages to straddle the line between another classic for the company and just another run-of-the-mill disney sequel intended for the home video market .	neg
rarely does a film so graceless and devoid of merit as this one come along .	neg
it's a thin notion , repetitively stretched out to feature length , awash in self-consciously flashy camera effects , droning house music and flat , flat dialogue .	neg
on a certain base level , blue crush delivers what it promises , just not well enough to recommend it .	neg
the colorful masseur wastes its time on mood rather than riding with the inherent absurdity of ganesh's rise up the social ladder .	neg
 . . . an incredibly heavy-handed , manipulative dud that feels all too familiar .	neg
wimps out by going for that pg-13 rating , so the more graphic violence is mostly off-screen and the sexuality is muted .	neg
trapped presents a frightening and compelling 'what if ? ' scenario that will give most parents pause . . . . then , something terrible happens .	neg
madonna has made herself over so often now , there's apparently nothing left to work with , sort of like michael jackson's nose .	neg
never having seen the first two films in the series , i can't compare friday after next to them , but nothing would change the fact that what we have here is a load of clams left in the broiling sun for a good three days .	neg
the story is lacking any real emotional impact , and the plot is both contrived and cliched .	neg
a depraved , incoherent , instantly disposable piece of hackery .	neg
it's a bad action movie because there's no rooting interest and the spectacle is grotesque and boring .	neg
[soderbergh] tends to place most of the psychological and philosophical material in italics rather than trust an audience's intelligence , and he creates an overall sense of brusqueness .	neg
handsome and sincere but slightly awkward in its combination of entertainment and evangelical boosterism .	neg
so aggressively cheery that pollyana would reach for a barf bag .	neg
scooby-doo doesn't know if it wants to be a retro-refitting exercise in campy recall for older fans or a silly , nickelodeon-esque kiddie flick .	neg
russell lacks the visual panache , the comic touch , and perhaps the budget of sommers's title-bout features .	neg
highly uneven and inconsistent . . . margarita happy hour kinda resembles the el cheapo margaritas served within .	neg
very stupid and annoying .	neg
the sum of all fears pretends to be a serious exploration of nuclear terrorism , but it's really nothing more than warmed-over cold war paranoia .	neg
a listless and desultory affair .	neg

any chekhov is better than no chekhov , but it would be a shame if this was your introduction to one of the greatest plays of the last 100 years .	neg
helmer hudlin tries to make a hip comedy , but his dependence on slapstick defeats the possibility of creating a more darkly edged tome .	neg
lazy , miserable and smug . this is one of the biggest disappointments of the year .	neg
formula 51 has dulled your senses faster and deeper than any recreational drug on the market .	neg
every visual joke is milked , every set-up obvious and lengthy , every punchline predictable . there's no energy .	neg
apparently writer-director attal thought he need only cast himself and his movie-star wife sitting around in their drawers to justify a film .	neg
after the setup , the air leaks out of the movie , flattening its momentum with about an hour to go .	neg
this is a poster movie , a mediocre tribute to films like them !	neg
at three hours and with very little story or character development , there is plenty of room for editing , and a much shorter cut surely would have resulted in a smoother , more focused narrative without sacrificing any of the cultural intrigue .	neg
a bit too derivative to stand on its own as the psychological thriller it purports to be .	neg
a crude teen-oriented variation on a theme that the playwright craig lucas explored with infinitely more grace and eloquence in his prelude to a kiss .	neg
the film's darker moments become smoothed over by an overwhelming need to tender inspirational tidings , especially in the last few cloying moments .	neg
if you recognize zeus ( the dog from snatch ) it will make you wish you were at home watching that movie instead of in the theater watching this one .	neg
abysmally pathetic	neg
this is the kind of movie that you only need to watch for about thirty seconds before you say to yourself , 'ah , yes , here we have a bad , bad , bad movie . '	neg
shanghai ghetto should be applauded for finding a new angle on a tireless story , but you might want to think twice before booking passage .	neg
plays like a checklist of everything rob reiner and his cast were sending up .	neg
there's too much forced drama in this wildly uneven movie , about a young man's battle with his inescapable past and uncertain future in a very shapable but largely unfulfilling present .	neg
it's at once laughable and compulsively watchable , in its committed dumbness .	neg
all the sensuality , all the eroticism of a good vampire tale has been , pardon the pun , sucked out and replaced by goth goofiness .	neg
a cross between blow and boyz n the hood , this movie strives to be more , but doesn't quite get there . good performances keep it from being a total rehash .	neg
the screenplay is hugely overwritten , with tons and tons of dialogue -- most of it given to children .	neg
troll the cult section of your local video store for the real deal .	neg
at times , the movie looks genuinely pretty . your nightmares , on the other hand , will be anything but . not even felinni would know what to make of this italian freakshow .	neg
elmo touts his drug as being 51 times stronger than coke . if you're looking for a tale of brits behaving badly , watch snatch again . it's 51 times better than this .	neg
it's difficult to conceive of anyone who has reached puberty actually finding the characters in slackers or their antics amusing , let alone funny .	neg
despite its promising cast of characters , big trouble remains a loosely tied series of vignettes which only prove that 'zany' doesn't necessarily mean 'funny . '	neg
both shrill and soporific , and because everything is repeated five or six times , it can seem tiresomely simpleminded .	neg
does not go far enough in its humor or stock ideas to stand out as particularly memorable or even all that funny .	neg
neither revelatory nor truly edgy--merely crassly flamboyant and comedically labored .	neg
just about everyone involved here seems to be coasting . there are a few modest laughs , but certainly no thrills .	neg
fails so fundamentally on every conventional level that it achieves some kind of goofy grandeur .	neg
there's a persistent theatrical sentiment and a woozy quality to the manner of the storytelling , which undercuts the devastatingly telling impact of utter loss personified in the film's simple title .	neg
while howard's appreciation of brown and his writing is clearly well-meaning and sincere , the movie would be impossible to sit through were it not for the supporting cast .	neg
a preposterous , prurient whodunit .	neg
go , girls , right down the reality drain .	neg
boasting some of the most poorly staged and lit action in memory , impostor is as close as you can get to an imitation movie .	neg
can be classified as one of those 'alternate reality' movies . . . except that it would have worked so much better dealing in only one reality .	neg
predictable and cloying , though brown sugar is so earnest in its yearning for the days before rap went nihilistic that it summons more spirit and bite than your average formulaic romantic quadrangle .	neg
 . . . unlikable , uninteresting , unfunny , and completely , utterly inept .	neg
the film is so busy making reference to other films and trying to be other films that it fails to have a heart , mind or humor of its own .	neg
an imponderably stilted and self-consciously arty movie .	neg
muddled , melodramatic paranormal romance is an all-time low for kevin costner .	neg
too clumsy in key moments . . . to make a big splash .	neg
just a bunch of good actors flailing around in a caper that's neither original nor terribly funny .	neg
`matrix'-style massacres erupt throughout . . . but the movie has a tougher time balancing its violence with kafka-inspired philosophy .	neg
at least it's a fairly impressive debut from the director , charles stone iii .	neg
it all unfolds predictably , and the adventures that happen along the way seem repetitive and designed to fill time , providing no real sense of suspense .	neg
wanker goths are on the loose ! run for your lives !	neg
why would anyone cast the magnificent jackie chan in a movie full of stunt doubles and special effects ?	neg
a grating , emaciated flick .	neg
unambitious writing emerges in the movie , using a plot that could have come from an animated-movie screenwriting textbook .	neg
presents a good case while failing to provide a reason for us to care beyond the very basic dictums of human decency .	neg
we have poignancy jostling against farce , thoughtful dialogue elbowed aside by one-liners , and a visual style that incorporates rotoscope animation for no apparent reason except , maybe , that it looks neat .	neg
 . . . unbearably lame .	neg
according to the script , grant and bullock's characters are made for each other . but you'd never guess that from the performances .	neg
the animation merely serves up a predictable , maudlin story that swipes heavily from bambi and the lion king , yet lacks the emotional resonance of either of those movies .	neg
ararat feels like a book report	neg
steve oedekerk is , alas , no woody allen .	neg
a lot like the imaginary sport it projects onto the screen -- loud , violent and mindless .	neg
an amalgam of the fugitive , blade runner , and total recall , only without much energy or tension .	neg
the acting is amateurish , the cinematography is atrocious , the direction is clumsy , the writing is insipid and the violence is at once luridly graphic and laughably unconvincing .	neg
shows that jackie chan is getting older , and that's something i would rather live in denial about	neg
with miscast leads , banal dialogue and an absurdly overblown climax , killing me softly belongs firmly in the so-bad-it's-good camp .	neg
alas , the black-and-white archival footage of their act showcases pretty mediocre shtick .	neg
the slapstick is labored , and the bigger setpieces flat .	neg
this is the kind of movie where people who have never picked a lock do so easily after a few tries and become expert fighters after a few weeks .	neg
the problem with the mayhem in formula 51 is not that it's offensive , but that it's boring .	neg
much of the digitally altered footage appears jagged , as if filmed directly from a television monitor , while the extensive use of stock footage quickly becomes a tiresome cliché .	neg
the film never rises above a conventional , two dimension tale	neg
mark wahlberg . . . may look classy in a '60s-homage pokepie hat , but as a character he's dry , dry , dry .	neg
told in scattered fashion , the movie only intermittently lives up to the stories and faces and music of the men who are its subject .	neg
the irony is that this film's cast is uniformly superb ; their performances could have -- should have -- been allowed to stand on their own .	neg
now i can see why people thought i was too hard on " the mothman prophecies " .	neg
if ever a concept came handed down from the movie gods on a silver platter , this is it . if ever such a dependable concept was botched in execution , this is it .	neg
with an unusual protagonist ( a kilt-wearing jackson ) and subject matter , the improbable " formula 51 " is somewhat entertaining , but it could have been much stronger .	neg
sandra bullock's best dramatic performance to date ( is ) almost enough to lift ( this ) thrill-kill cat-and-mouser . . . above its paint-by-numbers plot .	neg
a feel-good movie that doesn't give you enough to feel good about .	neg
adolescents will be adequately served by the movie's sophomoric blend of shenanigans and slapstick , although the more lascivious-minded might be disappointed in the relative modesty of a movie that sports a 'topless tutorial service . '	neg
this mistaken-identity picture is so film-culture referential that the final product is a ghost .	neg
the picture emerges as a surprisingly anemic disappointment .	neg
de niro cries . you'll cry for your money back .	neg
slap me , i saw this movie .	neg
[the kid's] just too bratty for sympathy , and as the film grows to its finale , his little changes ring hollow .	neg
behind the glitz , hollywood is sordid and disgusting . quelle surprise !	neg
scherfig , who has had a successful career in tv , tackles more than she can handle .	neg
just consider what new best friend does not have , beginning with the minor omission of a screenplay .	neg
oscar caliber cast doesn't live up to material	neg
the problems of the people in love in the time of money are hardly specific to their era . they just have problems , which are neither original nor are presented in convincing way .	neg
carrying this wafer-thin movie on his nimble shoulders , chan wades through putrid writing , direction and timing with a smile that says , 'if i stay positive , maybe i can channel one of my greatest pictures , drunken master . '	neg
so putrid it is not worth the price of the match that should be used to burn every print of the film .	neg
in the end , the movie bogs down in insignificance , saying nothing about kennedy's assassination and revealing nothing about the pathology it pretends to investigate .	neg
starts out ballsy and stylish but fails to keep it up and settles into clichés .	neg
sometimes makes less sense than the bruckheimeresque american action flicks it emulates .	neg
one of those films where the characters inhabit that special annex of hell where adults behave like kids , children behave like adults and everyone screams at the top of their lungs no matter what the situation .	neg
there's only one way to kill michael myers for good : stop buying tickets to these movies .	neg
bland but harmless .	neg
'rare birds' tries to force its quirkiness upon the audience .	neg
the movie is about as humorous as watching your favorite pet get buried alive .	neg
resident evil is what comes from taking john carpenter's ghosts of mars and eliminating the beheadings . in other words , about as bad a film you're likely to see all year .	neg
five screenwriters are credited with the cliché-laden screenplay ; it seems as if each watered down the version of the one before .	neg
the whole thing comes off like a particularly amateurish episode of bewitched that takes place during spring break .	neg
well made but uninvolving , bloodwork isn't a terrible movie , just a stultifyingly obvious one -- an unrewarding collar for a murder mystery .	neg
so we got ten little indians meets friday the 13th by way of clean and sober , filmed on the set of carpenter's the thing and loaded with actors you're most likely to find on the next inevitable incarnation of the love boat .	neg
the movie's blatant derivativeness is one reason it's so lackluster .	neg
la de salma es una versión de frida superficial , preciosista y sin ningún contenido .	neg
kids don't mind crappy movies as much as adults , provided there's lots of cute animals and clumsy people . 'snow dogs' has both .	neg
it's almost as if it's an elaborate dare more than a full-blooded film .	neg
wobbly senegalese updating of " carmen " which is best for the stunning star turn by djeinaba diop gai	neg
it's the humanizing stuff that will probably sink the film for anyone who doesn't think about percentages all day long .	neg
ken russell would love this . in one scene , we get a stab at soccer hooliganism , a double-barreled rip-off of quentin tarantino's climactic shootout — and meat loaf explodes .	neg
bella is the picture of health with boundless energy until a few days before she dies . this is absolutely and completely ridiculous and an insult to every family whose mother has suffered through the horrible pains of a death by cancer .	neg
the premise of " abandon " holds promise , . . . but its delivery is a complete mess .	neg
what could have been a pointed little chiller about the frightening seductiveness of new technology loses faith in its own viability and succumbs to joyless special-effects excess .	neg
a little too ponderous to work as shallow entertainment , not remotely incisive enough to qualify as drama , monsoon wedding serves mostly to whet one's appetite for the bollywood films .	neg
unless bob crane is someone of particular interest to you , this film's impressive performances and adept direction aren't likely to leave a lasting impression .	neg
the rock has a great presence but one battle after another is not the same as one battle followed by killer cgi effects .	neg
the bottom line with nemesis is the same as it has been with all the films in the series : fans will undoubtedly enjoy it , and the uncommitted needn't waste their time on it .	neg
the lousy john q all but spits out denzel washington's fine performance in the title role .	neg
the whole thing feels like a ruse , a tactic to cover up the fact that the picture is constructed around a core of flimsy -- or , worse yet , nonexistent -- ideas .	neg
what a stiflingly unfunny and unoriginal mess this is !	neg
the film is so packed with subplots involving the various silbersteins that it feels more like the pilot episode of a tv series than a feature film .	neg
opera on film is never satisfactory . the art demands live viewing . the innate theatrics that provide its thrills and extreme emotions lose their luster when flattened onscreen .	neg
despite all the closed-door hanky-panky , the film is essentially juiceless .	neg
it is parochial , accessible to a chosen few , standoffish to everyone else , and smugly suggests a superior moral tone is more important than filmmaking skill	neg
the sweetest thing leaves an awful sour taste .	neg
it's lost the politics and the social observation and become just another situation romance about a couple of saps stuck in an inarticulate screenplay .	neg
terminally bland , painfully slow and needlessly confusing . . . the movie , shot on digital videotape rather than film , is frequently indecipherable .	neg
as dumb and cheesy as they may be , the cartoons look almost shakespearean -- both in depth and breadth -- after watching this digital-effects-heavy , supposed family-friendly comedy .	neg
aloof and lacks any real raw emotion , which is fatal for a film that relies on personal relationships .	neg
a low-rent retread of the alien pictures .	neg
serviceable at best , slightly less than serviceable at worst .	neg
its initial excitement settles into a warmed over pastiche .	neg
a big meal of cliches that the talented cast generally chokes on .	neg
the story has little wit and no surprises .	neg
the merchant-ivory team continues to systematically destroy everything we hold dear about cinema , only now it's begun to split up so that it can do even more damage .	neg
what should have been a cutting hollywood satire is instead about as fresh as last week's issue of variety .	neg
hey everybody , wanna watch a movie in which a guy dressed as a children's party clown gets violently gang-raped ? i didn't think so .	neg
a little more intensity and a little less charm would have saved this film a world of hurt .	neg
dense and enigmatic . . . elusive . . . stagy and stilted	neg
[t]his slop doesn't even have potential as a cult film , as it's too loud to shout insults at the screen .	neg
the movie's plot is almost entirely witless and inane , carrying every gag two or three times beyond its limit to sustain a laugh .	neg
 . . . may work as an addictive guilty pleasure but the material never overcomes its questionable satirical ambivalence . this scarlet's letter is a . . . as in aimless , arduous , and arbitrary .	neg
plays like a glossy melodrama that occasionally verges on camp .	neg
the central character isn't complex enough to hold our interest .	neg
a modestly comic , modestly action-oriented world war ii adventure that , in terms of authenticity , is one of those films that requires the enemy to never shoot straight .	neg
a puppy dog so desperate for attention it nearly breaks its little neck trying to perform entertaining tricks .	neg
just about all of the film is confusing on one level or another , making ararat far more demanding than it needs to be .	neg
a little less extreme than in the past , with longer exposition sequences between them , and with fewer gags to break the tedium .	neg
there's a heavy stench of 'been there , done that' hanging over the film . it's everything you'd expect -- but nothing more .	neg
the biggest problem with satin rouge is lilia herself . she's a cipher , played by an actress who smiles and frowns but doesn't reveal an inner life .	neg
a quaint , romanticized rendering .	neg
what with the incessant lounge music playing in the film's background , you may mistake love liza for an adam sandler chanukah song .	neg
the movie's heavy-handed screenplay navigates a fast fade into pomposity and pretentiousness .	neg
a potentially good comic premise and excellent cast are terribly wasted .	neg
woody allen used to ridicule movies like hollywood ending . now he makes them .	neg
she's not yet an actress , not quite a singer . . .	neg
not a bad premise , but the execution is lackluster at best .	neg
been there done that .	neg
there is only so much baked cardboard i need to chew .	neg
a movie like the guys is why film criticism can be considered work .	neg
schnitzler's film has a great hook , some clever bits and well-drawn , if standard issue , characters , but is still only partly satisfying .	neg
even if it made its original release date last fall , it would've reeked of a been-there , done-that sameness .	neg
only two-fifths of a satisfying movie experience .	neg
a loud , ugly , irritating movie without any of its satirical salvos hitting a discernible target .	neg
[l]ame and unnecessary .	neg
a movie version of a paint-by-numbers picture . we can tell what it is supposed to be , but can't really call it a work of art .	neg
it's a brilliant , honest performance by nicholson , but the film is an agonizing bore except when the fantastic kathy bates turns up . bravado kathy !	neg
 . . . liotta is put in an impossible spot because his character's deceptions ultimately undo him and the believability of the entire scenario . too bad .	neg
you can thank me for this . i saw juwanna mann so you don't have to .	neg
unfunny and lacking any sense of commitment to or affection for its characters , the reginald hudlin comedy relies on toilet humor , ethnic slurs .	neg
basically , it's pretty but dumb .	neg
this romantic/comedy asks the question how much souvlaki can you take before indigestion sets in .	neg
squandering his opportunity to make absurdist observations , burns gets caught up in the rush of slapstick thoroughfare .	neg
there's a neat twist , subtly rendered , that could have wrapped things up at 80 minutes , but kang tacks on three or four more endings .	neg
reeboir varies between a sweet smile and an angry bark , while said attempts to wear down possible pupils through repetition . it has no affect on the kurds , but it wore me down .	neg
the actors improvise and scream their way around this movie directionless , lacking any of the rollicking dark humor so necessary to make this kind of idea work on screen .	neg
co-writer/director jonathan parker's attempts to fashion a brazil-like , hyper-real satire fall dreadfully short .	neg
if this silly little cartoon can inspire a few kids not to grow up to be greedy bastards , more power to it .	neg
a superfluous sequel . . . plagued by that old familiar feeling of 'let's get this thing over with' : everyone has shown up at the appointed time and place , but visible enthusiasm is mighty hard to find .	neg
if there's a heaven for bad movies , deuces wild is on its way .	neg
comes off like a bad imitation of the bard .	neg
what's missing in murder by numbers is any real psychological grounding for the teens' deviant behaviour . being latently gay and liking to read are hardly enough .	neg
an uninspired preachy and clichéd war film .	neg
horrendously amateurish filmmaking that is plainly dull and visually ugly when it isn't incomprehensible .	neg
a movie that harps on media-constructed 'issues' like whether compromise is the death of self… this orgasm [won't be an] exceedingly memorable one for most people .	neg
slackers' jokey approach to college education is disappointingly simplistic -- the film's biggest problem -- and there are no unforgettably stupid stunts or uproariously rude lines of dialogue to remember it by .	neg
if festival in cannes nails hard- boiled hollywood argot with a bracingly nasty accuracy , much about the film , including some of its casting , is frustratingly unconvincing .	neg
the movie is too impressed with its own solemn insights to work up much entertainment value .	neg
i haven't seen such self-amused trash since freddy got fingered .	neg
little more than a well-mounted history lesson .	neg
rob schneider's infantile cross-dressing routines fill the hot chick , the latest gimmick from this unimaginative comedian .	neg
a horrible , 99-minute stink bomb .	neg
the film is weighed down by supporting characters who are either too goodly , wise and knowing or downright comically evil .	neg
her fans walked out muttering words like " horrible " and " terrible , " but had so much fun dissing the film that they didn't mind the ticket cost . in this case zero .	neg
the film is so bad it doesn't improve upon the experience of staring at a blank screen .	neg
sheridan's take on the author's schoolboy memoir . . . is a rather toothless take on a hard young life .	neg
it jumps around with little logic or continuity , presenting backstage bytes of information that never amount to a satisfying complete picture of this particular , anciently demanding métier .	neg
how i killed my father is one of those art house films that makes you feel like you're watching an iceberg melt -- only it never melts .	neg
when it comes to the battle of hollywood vs . woo , it looks like woo's a p . o . w .	neg
there are a few chuckles , but not a single gag sequence that really scores , and the stars seem to be in two different movies .	neg
the chateau has one very funny joke and a few other decent ones , but all it amounts to is a mildly funny , sometimes tedious , ultimately insignificant film .	neg
it's dull , spiritless , silly and monotonous : an ultra-loud blast of pointless mayhem , going nowhere fast .	neg
the mushy finale turns john q into a movie-of-the-week tearjerker .	neg
content merely to lionize its title character and exploit his anger - all for easy sanctimony , formulaic thrills and a ham-fisted sermon on the need for national health insurance .	neg
the movie turns out to be [assayas'] homage to the gallic 'tradition of quality , ' in all its fusty squareness .	neg
its message has merit and , in the hands of a brutally honest individual like prophet jack , might have made a point or two regarding life .	neg
[seems] even more uselessly redundant and shamelessly money-grubbing than most third-rate horror sequels .	neg
it's hard to imagine that even very small children will be impressed by this tired retread .	neg
neither as scary-funny as tremors nor demented-funny as starship troopers , the movie isn't tough to take as long as you've paid a matinee price .	neg
if swimfan does catch on , it may be because teens are looking for something to make them laugh .	neg
what might've been an exhilarating exploration of an odd love triangle becomes a sprawl of uncoordinated vectors .	neg
the master of disguise may have made a great saturday night live sketch , but a great movie it is not .	neg
it's quite an achievement to set and shoot a movie at the cannes film festival and yet fail to capture its visual appeal or its atmosphere .	neg
boll uses a lot of quick cutting and blurry step-printing to goose things up , but dopey dialogue and sometimes inadequate performances kill the effect .	neg
it's always disappointing when a documentary fails to live up to -- or offer any new insight into -- its chosen topic . unfortunately , that's precisely what arthur dong's family fundamentals does .	neg
has the marks of a septuagenarian ; it's a crusty treatment of a clever gimmick .	neg
like a medium-grade network sitcom--mostly inoffensive , fitfully amusing , but ultimately so weightless that a decent draft in the auditorium might blow it off the screen .	neg
something must have been lost in the translation .	neg
becomes the last thing you would expect from a film with this title or indeed from any plympton film : boring .	neg
in the end , the film feels homogenized and a bit contrived , as if we're looking back at a tattered and ugly past with rose-tinted glasses .	neg
chan's stunts are limited and so embellished by editing that there's really not much of a sense of action or even action-comedy .	neg
rock's stand-up magic wanes . hopkins , squarely fills the screen . action - mechanical .	neg
 " the tuxedo " should have been the vehicle for chan that " the mask " was for jim carrey . alas , it's the man that makes the clothes .	neg
for casual moviegoers who stumble into rules expecting a slice of american pie hijinks starring the kid from dawson's creek , they'll probably run out screaming .	neg
the biggest problem i have ( other than the very sluggish pace ) is we never really see her esther blossom as an actress , even though her talent is supposed to be growing .	neg
what puzzles me is the lack of emphasis on music in britney spears' first movie .	neg
plot , characters , drama , emotions , ideas -- all are irrelevant to the experience of seeing the scorpion king .	neg
city by the sea is a gritty police thriller with all the dysfunctional family dynamics one could wish for . but how it washed out despite all of that is the project's prime mystery .	neg
whatever the movie's sentimental , hypocritical lessons about sexism , its true colors come out in various wet t-shirt and shower scenes .	neg
as a hybrid teen thriller and murder mystery , murder by numbers fits the profile too closely .	neg
there ain't a lot more painful than an unfunny movie that thinks it's hilarious .	neg
i enjoyed the movie in a superficial way , while never sure what its purpose was .	neg
what a pity . . . that the material is so second-rate .	neg
doesn't deliver a great story , nor is the action as gripping as in past seagal films .	neg
the kind of film that leaves you scratching your head in amazement over the fact that so many talented people could participate in such an ill-advised and poorly executed idea .	neg
nicks refuses to let slackers be seen as just another teen movie , which means he can be forgiven for frequently pandering to fans of the gross-out comedy .	neg
nothing about the film -- with the possible exception of elizabeth hurley's breasts -- is authentic .	neg
amid the cliché and foreshadowing , cage manages a degree of casual realism . . . that is routinely dynamited by blethyn .	neg
mostly , shafer and co-writer gregory hinton lack a strong-minded viewpoint , or a sense of humor .	neg
no cliche escapes the perfervid treatment of gang warfare called ces wild .	neg
eddie murphy and owen wilson have a cute partnership in i spy , but the movie around them is so often nearly nothing that their charm doesn't do a load of good .	neg
strictly a 'guy's film' in the worst sense of the expression .	neg
there's some good material in their story about a retail clerk wanting more out of life , but the movie too often spins its wheels with familiar situations and repetitive scenes .	neg
it's a lot to ask people to sit still for two hours and change watching such a character , especially when rendered in as flat and impassive a manner as phoenix's .	neg
there's something fishy about a seasonal holiday kids' movie . . . that derives its moment of most convincing emotional gravity from a scene where santa gives gifts to grownups .	neg
we're left with a story that tries to grab us , only to keep letting go at all the wrong moments .	neg

after a while , the only way for a reasonably intelligent person to get through the country bears is to ponder how a whole segment of pop-music history has been allowed to get wet , fuzzy and sticky .	neg

an awkwardly contrived exercise in magic realism .	neg

this is a heartfelt story . . . it just isn't a very involving one .	neg
these self-styled athletes have banged their brains into the ground so frequently and furiously , their capacity to explain themselves has gone the same way as their natural instinct for self-preservation .	neg
the fact that the 'best part' of the movie comes from a 60-second homage to one of demme's good films doesn't bode well for the rest of it .	neg
richard pryor mined his personal horrors and came up with a treasure chest of material , but lawrence gives us mostly fool's gold .	neg
the band performances featured in drumline are red hot . . . [but] from a mere story point of view , the film's ice cold .	neg
 . . . built on the premise that middle-class arkansas consists of monster truck-loving good ol' boys and peroxide blond honeys whose worldly knowledge comes from tv reruns and supermarket tabloids .	neg
a laughable -- or rather , unlaughable -- excuse for a film .	neg
the sequel is everything the original was not : contrived , overblown and tie-in ready .	neg
like a grinning jack o' lantern , its apparent glee is derived from a lobotomy , having had all its vital essence scooped out and discarded .	neg

plays like an unbalanced mixture of graphic combat footage and almost saccharine domestic interludes that are pure hollywood .	neg
mctiernan's remake may be lighter on its feet -- the sober-minded original was as graceful as a tap-dancing rhino -- but it is just as boring and as obvious .	neg
high crimes carries almost no organic intrigue as a government/ marine/legal mystery , and that's because the movie serves up all of that stuff , nearly subliminally , as the old-hat province of male intrigue .	neg
this movie is about the worst thing chan has done in the united states .	neg
the explosion essentially ruined -- or , rather , overpowered -- the fiction of the movie for me .	neg
this ludicrous film is predictable at every turn .	neg
an incredibly irritating comedy about thoroughly vacuous people . . . manages to embody the worst excesses of nouvelle vague without any of its sense of fun or energy .	neg
the film desperately sinks further and further into comedy futility .	neg
instead of a balanced film that explains the zeitgeist that is the x games , we get a cinematic postcard that's superficial and unrealized .	neg
the crassness of this reactionary thriller is matched only by the ridiculousness of its premise .	neg
i wish it would have just gone more over-the-top instead of trying to have it both ways .	neg
the superior plotline isn't quite enough to drag along the dead ( water ) weight of the other .	neg
the film doesn't really care about the thousands of americans who die hideously , it cares about how ryan meets his future wife and makes his start at the cia .	neg

it's mildly sentimental , unabashedly consumerist . . . studiously inoffensive and completely disposable .	neg
like its title character , esther kahn is unusual but unfortunately also irritating .	neg
the star who helped give a spark to " chasing amy " and " changing lanes " falls flat as thinking man cia agent jack ryan in this summer's new action film , " the sum of all fears . "	neg
a summary of the plot doesn't quite do justice to the awfulness of the movie , for that comes through all too painfully in the execution .	neg
every conceivable mistake a director could make in filming opera has been perpetrated here .	neg
snoots will no doubt rally to its cause , trotting out threadbare standbys like 'masterpiece' and 'triumph' and all that malarkey , but rarely does an established filmmaker so ardently waste viewers' time with a gobbler like this .	neg
[the film's] taste for " shock humor " will wear thin on all but those weaned on the comedy of tom green and the farrelly brothers .	neg
any enjoyment will be hinge from a personal threshold of watching sad but endearing characters do extremely unconventional things .	neg
if legendary shlockmeister ed wood had ever made a movie about a vampire , it probably would look a lot like this alarming production , adapted from anne rice's novel the vampire chronicles .	neg
hardly a nuanced portrait of a young woman's breakdown , the film nevertheless works up a few scares .	neg
interminably bleak , to say nothing of boring .	neg
things really get weird , though not particularly scary : the movie is all portent and no content .	neg
it's difficult to discern if this is a crazy work of disturbed genius or merely 90 minutes of post-adolescent electra rebellion .	neg

the camera whirls ! the camera twirls ! oh , look at that clever angle ! wow , a jump cut !	neg
demme finally succeeds in diminishing his stature from oscar-winning master to lowly studio hack .	neg
the action scenes have all the suspense of a 20-car pileup , while the plot holes are big enough for a train car to drive through -- if kaos hadn't blown them all up .	neg
it almost feels as if the movie is more interested in entertaining itself than in amusing us .	neg
it puts washington , as honest working man john q . archibald , on a pedestal , then keeps lifting the pedestal higher .	neg
ultimately , the film amounts to being lectured to by tech-geeks , if you're up for that sort of thing .	neg
far more enjoyable than its predecessor .	neg
[gayton's script] telegraphs every discovery and layers on the gloss of convenience .	neg
full frontal , which opens today nationwide , could almost be classified as a movie-industry satire , but it lacks the generous inclusiveness that is the genre's definitive , if disingenuous , feature .	neg

[allen's] been making piffle for a long while , and hollywood ending may be his way of saying that piffle is all that the airhead movie business deserves from him right now .	neg
an exercise in cynicism every bit as ugly as the shabby digital photography and muddy sound .	neg
mildly amusing .	neg
not good enough to pass for a litmus test of the generation gap and not bad enough to repulse any generation of its fans .	neg
the movie is silly beyond comprehension , and even if it weren't silly , it would still be beyond comprehension .	neg
watchable up until the point where the situations and the dialogue spin hopelessly out of control -- that is to say , when carol kane appears on the screen .	neg
the scriptwriters are no less a menace to society than the film's characters .	neg
fairly run-of-the-mill .	neg

it's a frightful vanity film that , no doubt , pays off what debt miramax felt they owed to benigni .	neg
a muddy psychological thriller rife with miscalculations . it makes me say the obvious : abandon all hope of a good movie ye who enter here .	neg

little more than a super-sized infomercial for the cable-sports channel and its summer x games .	neg
degenerates into hogwash .	neg
a generic bloodbath that often becomes laughably unbearable when it isn't merely offensive .	neg
julie davis is the kathie lee gifford of film directors , sadly proving once again ego doesn't always go hand in hand with talent .	neg
an unholy mess , driven by the pathetic idea that if you shoot something on crummy-looking videotape , it must be labelled 'hip' , 'innovative' and 'realistic' .	neg
the story's pathetic and the gags are puerile .	neg

i was sent a copyof this film to review on dvd . for free . i still want my money back .	neg
it plods along methodically , somehow under the assumption that its " dead wife communicating from beyond the grave " framework is even remotely new or interesting .	neg
it's hard to believe that a relationship like holly and marina's could survive the hothouse emotions of teendom , and its longevity gets more inexplicable as the characterizations turn more crassly reductive .	neg
all too familiar . . . basically the sort of cautionary tale that was old when 'angels with dirty faces' appeared in 1938 .	neg
…passable enough for a shoot-out in the o . k . court house of life type of flick . strictly middle of the road .	neg
although purportedly a study in modern alienation , it's really little more than a particularly slanted , gay s/m fantasy , enervating and deadeningly drawn-out .	neg
after the first 10 minutes , which is worth seeing , the movie sinks into an abyss of clichés , depression and bad alternative music .	neg
no one can doubt the filmmakers' motives , but the guys still feels counterproductive .	neg

well-meaning to a fault , antwone fisher manages the dubious feat of turning one man's triumph of will into everyman's romance comedy .	neg
seemingly disgusted with the lazy material and the finished product's unshapely look , director fisher stevens inexplicably dips key moments from the film in waking life water colors .	neg
formula 51 promises a new kind of high but delivers the same old bad trip .	neg
everything that was right about blade is wrong in its sequel .	neg
a few energetic stunt sequences briefly enliven the film , but the wheezing terrorist subplot hasn't the stamina for the 100-minute running time , and the protagonists' bohemian boorishness mars the spirit of good clean fun .	neg
the film was produced by jerry bruckheimer and directed by joel schumacher , and reflects the worst of their shallow styles : wildly overproduced , inadequately motivated every step of the way and demographically targeted to please every one ( and no one ) .	neg
disney again ransacks its archives for a quick-buck sequel .	neg
 coarse , cliched and clunky , this trifling romantic comedy in which opposites attract for no better reason than that the screenplay demands it squanders the charms of stars hugh grant and sandra bullock .	neg
anyone who suffers through this film deserves , at the very least , a big box of consolation candy .	neg
how much you are moved by the emotional tumult of [françois and michèle's] relationship depends a lot on how interesting and likable you find them .	neg
they presume their audience won't sit still for a sociology lesson , however entertainingly presented , so they trot out the conventional science-fiction elements of bug-eyed monsters and futuristic women in skimpy clothes .	neg
collapses after 30 minutes into a slap-happy series of adolescent violence .	neg
the following things are not at all entertaining : the bad sound , the lack of climax and , worst of all , watching seinfeld ( who is also one of the film's producers ) do everything he can to look like a good guy .	neg
attal's hang-ups surrounding infidelity are so old-fashioned and , dare i say , outdated , it's a wonder that he couldn't have brought something fresher to the proceedings simply by accident .	neg
obvious , obnoxious and didactic burlesque .	neg
the most surprising thing about this film is that they are actually releasing it into theaters .	neg
michele is a such a brainless flibbertigibbet that it's hard to take her spiritual quest at all seriously .	neg
ultimately , clarity matters , both in breaking codes and making movies . enigma lacks it .	neg
potty-mouthed enough for pg-13 , yet not as hilariously raunchy as south park , this strangely schizo cartoon seems suited neither to kids or adults .	neg
 . . . has its moments , but ultimately , its curmudgeon doesn't quite make the cut of being placed on any list of favorites .	neg
a distinctly minor effort that will be seen to better advantage on cable , especially considering its barely feature-length running time of one hour .	neg
most of the movie is so deadly dull that watching the proverbial paint dry would be a welcome improvement .	neg
in the end , tuck everlasting falls victim to that everlasting conundrum experienced by every human who ever lived : too much to do , too little time to do it in .	neg
rather less than the sum of its underventilated père-fils confrontations .	neg
mckay shows crushingly little curiosity about , or is ill-equipped to examine , the interior lives of the characters in his film , much less incorporate them into his narrative .	neg
plays like a series of vignettes -- clips of a film that are still looking for a common through-line .	neg
new yorkers always seem to find the oddest places to dwell . . .	neg
amid the shock and curiosity factors , the film is just a corny examination of a young actress trying to find her way .	neg

a characteristically engorged and sloppy coming-of-age movie .	neg
a somewhat disappointing and meandering saga .	neg
whenever you think you've seen the end of the movie , we cut to a new scene , which also appears to be the end . but , no , we get another scene , and then another . you begin to long for the end credits as the desert does for rain .	neg
an empty , ugly exercise in druggy trance-noir and trumped-up street credibility .	neg
the screenplay , co-written by director imogen kimmel , lacks the wit necessary to fully exploit the comic elements of the premise , making the proceedings more bizarre than actually amusing .	neg
the milieu is wholly unconvincing . . . and the histrionics reach a truly annoying pitch .	neg
unfunny comedy with a lot of static set ups , not much camera movement , and most of the scenes take place indoors in formal settings with motionless characters .	neg
each story is built on a potentially interesting idea , but the first two are ruined by amateurish writing and acting , while the third feels limited by its short running time .	neg
except for paymer as the boss who ultimately expresses empathy for bartleby's pain , the performances are so stylized as to be drained of human emotion .	neg
will no doubt delight plympton's legion of fans ; others may find 80 minutes of these shenanigans exhausting .	neg
the laughs are as rare as snake foo yung .	neg
for a film that celebrates radical , nonconformist values , what to do in case of fire ? lazily and glumly settles into a most traditional , reserved kind of filmmaking .	neg
knockaround guys plays like a student film by two guys who desperately want to be quentin tarantino when they grow up . but they lack their idol's energy and passion for detail .	neg
mattei so completely loses himself to the film's circular structure to ever offer any insightful discourse on , well , love in the time of money .	neg
it briefly flirts with player masochism , but the point of real interest -– audience sadism -- is evaded completely .	neg
holland lets things peter out midway , but it's notably better acted -- and far less crass - than some other recent efforts in the burgeoning genre of films about black urban professionals .	neg
for every articulate player , such as skateboarder tony hawk or bmx rider mat hoffman , are about a half dozen young turks angling to see how many times they can work the words " radical " or " suck " into a sentence .	neg
there's not a fresh idea at the core of this tale .	neg
an impenetrable and insufferable ball of pseudo-philosophic twaddle .	neg
it's unfortunate that wallace , who wrote gibson's braveheart as well as the recent pearl harbor , has such an irrepressible passion for sappy situations and dialogue .	neg
i liked the movie , but i know i would have liked it more if it had just gone that one step further . i'm left slightly disappointed that it didn't .	neg
dreary tale of middle-class angst	neg
for a movie about the power of poetry and passion , there is precious little of either .	neg
[jackson and bledel] seem to have been picked not for their acting chops , but for their looks and appeal to the pre-teen crowd .	neg
lillard and cardellini earn their scooby snacks , but not anyone else .	neg
like schindler's list , the grey zone attempts to be grandiloquent , but ends up merely pretentious -- in a grisly sort of way .	neg
an unremittingly ugly movie to look at , listen to , and think about , it is quite possibly the sturdiest example yet of why the dv revolution has cheapened the artistry of making a film .	neg
[screenwriter] pimental took the farrelly brothers comedy and feminized it , but it is a rather poor imitation .	neg
it's kind of sad that so many people put so much time and energy into this turkey .	neg
friday after next is a lot more bluster than bite .	neg
its juxtaposition of overwrought existentialism and stomach-churning gore will have you forever on the verge of either cracking up or throwing up .	neg
a decidedly mixed bag .	neg
meandering and confusing .	neg
there are cheesy backdrops , ridiculous action sequences , and many tired jokes about men in heels .	neg
ice cube isn't quite out of ripe screwball ideas , but friday after next spreads them pretty thin .	neg
not everything in the film works , including its somewhat convenient ending .	neg
the characters , cast in impossibly contrived situations , are totally estranged from reality .	neg
everything else about high crimes is , like the military system of justice it portrays , tiresomely regimented .	neg
just dreadful . i don't blame eddie murphy but shouldn't owen wilson know a movie must have a story and a script ?	neg
sweet home alabama certainly won't be remembered as one of [witherspoon's] better films .	neg
hard as this may be to believe , here on earth , a surprisingly similar teen drama , was a better film .	neg
this is just lazy writing . even kids deserve better .	neg
the pretensions -- and disposable story -- sink the movie . and diesel isn't the actor to save it .	neg
bravo reveals the true intent of her film by carefully selecting interview subjects who will construct a portrait of castro so predominantly charitable it can only be seen as propaganda .	neg
 . . . a preachy parable stylized with a touch of john woo bullet ballet .	neg
frank capra played this story straight . but the 2002 film doesn't really believe in it , and breaks the mood with absurdly inappropriate 'comedy' scenes .	neg
how about starting with a more original story instead of just slapping extreme humor and gross-out gags on top of the same old crap ?	neg
the problem is that for the most part , the film is deadly dull .	neg
handled correctly , wilde's play is a masterpiece of elegant wit and artifice . here , alas , it collapses like an overcooked soufflé .	neg
 " sorority boys " was funnier , and that movie was pretty bad .	neg
a bizarre piece of work , with premise and dialogue at the level of kids' television and plot threads as morose as teen pregnancy , rape and suspected murder	neg
paul bettany is good at being the ultra-violent gangster wannabe , but the movie is certainly not number 1 .	neg
it's a gag that's worn a bit thin over the years , though don't ask still finds a few chuckles .	neg
an uplifting drama . . . what antwone fisher isn't , however , is original .	neg
often likable , but just as often it's meandering , low on energy , and too eager to be quirky at moments when a little old-fashioned storytelling would come in handy .	neg
certain to be distasteful to children and adults alike , eight crazy nights is a total misfire .	neg
elaborate special effects take centre screen , so that the human story is pushed to one side .	neg
showtime isn't particularly assaultive , but it can still make you feel that you never want to see another car chase , explosion or gunfight again .	neg
all the characters are clinically depressed and have abandoned their slim hopes and dreams .	neg
this tuxedo . . . should have been sent back to the tailor for some major alterations .	neg

what's most offensive isn't the waste of a good cast , but the film's denial of sincere grief and mourning in favor of bogus spiritualism .	neg
sunk by way too much indulgence of scene-chewing , teeth-gnashing actorliness .	neg
fans of plympton's shorts may marginally enjoy the film , but it is doubtful this listless feature will win him any new viewers .	neg
barrels along at the start before becoming mired in sentimentality .	neg
none of this sounds promising and , indeed , the first half of sorority boys is as appalling as any 'comedy' to ever spill from a projector's lens .	neg
the kind of movie that leaves vague impressions and a nasty aftertaste but little clear memory of its operational mechanics .	neg
'punch-drunk love is so convinced of its own brilliance that , if it were a person , you'd want to smash its face in . '	neg

what 'blade runner' would've looked like as a low-budget series on a uhf channel .	neg

with its lackadaisical plotting and mindless action , all about the benjamins evokes the bottom tier of blaxploitation flicks from the 1970s .	neg
it never quite makes it to the boiling point , but manages to sustain a good simmer for most of its running time .	neg
loud , silly , stupid and pointless .	neg
mandel holland's direction is uninspired , and his scripting unsurprising , but the performances by phifer and black are ultimately winning . you'll find yourself wishing that you and they were in another movie .	neg

director tom shadyac and star kevin costner glumly mishandle the story's promising premise of a physician who needs to heal himself .	neg

you come away thinking not only that kate isn't very bright , but that she hasn't been worth caring about and that maybe she , janine and molly -- an all-woman dysfunctional family -- deserve one another .	neg
the metaphors are provocative , but too often , the viewer is left puzzled by the mechanics of the delivery .	neg
very much a home video , and so devoid of artifice and purpose that it appears not to have been edited at all .	neg
too much power , not enough puff .	neg
the attempt to build up a pressure cooker of horrified awe emerges from the simple fact that the movie has virtually nothing to show .	neg

a terrible movie that some people will nevertheless find moving .	neg
there are many definitions of 'time waster' but this movie must surely be one of them .	neg
